        "output": "10 Simple Habits to Reduce Stress at Work\n“Stress” is a buzzword these days. It’s hard not to encounter when you’re on the job, what with deadlines, office politics, long hours, and family drama all vying for your attention. The good news is that you don’t have to be a victim of stress – in fact, there are many things you can do to decrease your stress levels. By making simple lifestyle changes, you can reduce workplace stress and maintain your sanity.\n1. Relieve stress by getting organized.: The key to reducing stress at work is to eliminate the chaos that comes from disorganization. If you keep your desk and workspace neat and tidy, you will feel more relaxed, and you won’t spend as much time looking for lost papers or digging through piles of paperwork. A clean work space also gives you a sense of control over your environment.\nAsk your employer if you can designate a specific folder for incoming paperwork, so you know where to look for it. Fill folders with related materials, such as items requesting the same action from you. Label files and drawers so you can quickly identify them, especially if you work in a large office.\nKeep a to-do list or schedule. Crossing completed items/tasks off will give you a sense of satisfaction. You can use a whiteboard, a piece of paper, or an app to keep track of your tasks. Keep your list simple, so you can easily refer to it throughout the day.\n2. Relieve stress by being realistic.: When you set goals for yourself, make sure they’re achievable. Not only will setting realistic goals help you avoid disappointment, but it will prevent you from feeling rushed or stressed. If you find yourself overwhelmed, reevaluate your goals"

See if the leaves are turning yellow because they’re living in too much sunlight, or not enough water.

Crack eggs into a small bowl and add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of cold water. Beat the eggs with a fork until they have a uniform, smooth consistency. To make an omlette you can beat in some milk and seasoning, which makes them even tastier.\nYou can also use a whisk to break up the eggs if you don’t have a fork.\n2.

You should be able to place at least one finger between the surface of the water and the bottom of the pan without touching the bottom of the pan.\nMake sure that the water doesn’t reach too high. Place a lid on the pan. This will stop a lot of steam from getting out, which means that your eggs won’t end up being overcooked.\n3. Gently slide your eggs into the pan once the water is hot.

        "output": "Why is it that parents in a wealthy neighborhood have more resources to put into their child's education than those in a low income neighborhood?\nThis question seems to be asking for a compare and contrast essay. I will try my best to answer the question as asked, but I will add some information to make it easier to compare and contrast.\nFirst off, there are good schools and bad schools within every district. The difference between the two is usually money. A wealthy school district can spend much more per student than a poor school district, simply because they have more money coming in from property taxes. This does not always translate to better results though. Some affluent school districts have high drop-out rates or low test scores, while some poor districts have excellent scores.\nIn terms of resources, the main difference between a \"good\" school district and a \"bad\" one is funding. Generally speaking, schools with higher property values have more money to spend than schools with lower property values. This means that wealthier families tend to live in areas with better schools, and poorer families are trapped in neighborhoods with lower performing schools. It should also be noted that due to desegregation laws, many school districts have a mix of students from various economic backgrounds. In these cases, the funding disparity still exists, but is less pronounced.\nA final note, education policy is a hotly debated topic among politicians and academics alike. While there is general agreement about the need to raise standards and measure achievement, there is no consensus on how to do so. Many people feel that standardized testing is a good way to measure progress, while others feel that this type of measurement is too limited. There is also disagreement about how to help struggling schools. Some favor privatization, while others prefer to invest more money into public schools.

        "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a boon for the canine population. Not only are dogs being adopted in record numbers, but they are also being used to detect COVID-19 patients with impressive accuracy. Now, researchers reporting in ACS' Analytical Chemistry have found that dogs can accurately identify infected people with as much precision as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test—the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing the disease.\nDogs have a well-documented sense of smell that is hundreds of times more acute than that of humans. Previous research has shown that dogs can sniff out everything from cancer to land mines and even predict epileptic seizures. They can even tell when their owners are about to give birth. These capabilities have raised interest in developing a \"breathalyzer\" that dogs could use to screen for diseases. In the new study, researchers wanted to see if dogs could accurately detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in exhaled breath.\nYoshihiro Sakurai and colleagues conducted a small trial involving 24 people who were either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or were healthy controls. Each person blew into a bag containing cotton swabs that had been dusted with the virus. The team gave each dog 10 swabs to sniff during a 40-minute session. The dogs correctly identified 16 of the 17 positive samples and no negative samples, for a 94% overall accuracy. When the researchers applied a PCR test to the same samples, it correctly identified all 17 positive samples and zero negative ones, again with perfect accuracy. The results support the view that dogs have exceptional odor detection abilities and suggest that a device based on this idea"

The researchers found that false political news stories were more likely to be shared on Facebook than the truth — and that this trend continued after the election.\nThe researchers also found that the top 1 percent of false-news spreaders were responsible for sharing about one-third of all misinformation on the platform during the period they studied.\n“We find that false news was more novel, had more social media sharing, and was posted by accounts with fewer followers than the true news,” says Soroush Vosoughi, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and lead author of a paper describing the research.\nIn addition, the researchers found that false news was more likely to be backed up with no sources or nonsense citations. And they discovered that false news stories tended to gain traction soon after they were posted, particularly among Republicans.\nThe researchers analyzed more than 126,000 news stories shared on Facebook between April 2014 and November 2016.

        "input": "",
        "output": "By Krista Varady, PhD, CNS and Katherine Brooking, MS\nThe way we eat has a lot to do with culture, social norms, and economic factors. Making healthy food choices is not always easy in our society where fast food restaurants are abundant and the cost of fresh fruits and vegetables can be prohibitive for many people. But there are things we can do as individuals and as a society to change our eating patterns. Here’s how cultural, social, and economic factors influence people’s food choices and how this knowledge can be used to promote healthier diets.\nOur society has a love affair with convenience and speed. We want meals at our fingertips, ready when we are. This mentality has led to the proliferation of fast food restaurants. In fact, the average American spends 13% of their day consuming food away from home (2). Fast food restaurants offer cheap, high calorie food that is convenient for busy people on the go. These restaurants use fat, sugar, and salt to make their food taste good. Because of this, these types of food have become addictive, making it difficult for some people to eat anything else.\nIn addition, the relatively low cost of fast food means that many people rely on these restaurants for their main source of food (3). The cost of produce, however, is much higher than that of processed foods. This makes it hard for some people to afford healthy food options. Further, farmers in developing countries may grow certain types of crops because they make more money, even though these crops may not be the healthiest for us.\nEven if one can afford healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, different cultures have different tastes and preferences. Many people in the US live in “food deserts,”"

Paper maps and asking for directions allow people to have a backup plan in case of technology failure.\n2.

The Native Americans may have established trade routes with Europeans and Africans, leading to a more interconnected world. They may also have brought their own unique cultural practices and beliefs to the new land, which could have influenced the development of the local culture.\nHowever, there are also potential negative consequences to consider. For example, the Native Americans may have faced discrimination and oppression from European colonizers who viewed them as inferior. This could have led to the loss of their traditional ways of life and cultures. Additionally, the environmental impact of colonization could have been devastating, as the Europeans brought with them diseases and other factors that disrupted the balance of the local ecosystem.\nOverall, it is impossible to say for sure what would have happened if a Native American civilization had been the first to cross the Atlantic.

One of these scientists is Stephen Hawking, who has stated that we only have 1,000 years left to colonize space before we're wiped out by our own planetary problems.\nStill, even if we don't manage to colonize space until we solve those problems, it's likely we will develop the technology to detect and communicate with other intelligent life in the universe. So just how far away is that? And what does this mean for humanity's future? Read on for an analysis of when we will make first contact with an alien intelligence according to various scientists and experts.\nIn his book The Great Silence: A History of the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life and Its Impact on the Human Imagination, astronomer Paul Murdin writes, \"Alien life may be abundant, it may be rare, or it may exist nowhere at all. We just don’t know and probably won’t know for centuries.\"\nThere are multiple reasons why it's so hard to find evidence of alien life in the universe, or simply hear from an extraterrestrial intelligence. For one thing, the distances between stars are vast, and the nearest star system is some four light-years away (that's 25 trillion miles). Even if we could somehow travel faster than the speed of light — and no one thinks we can — it would still take centuries to cross the galaxy.\nEven if we did find life on another planet, there's no guarantee it would be intelligent.

If we were all born atheists there would be no such thing as religion. I think everyone should have the right to believe what they want to believe and not be persecuted for it.\nThe Bible says God made us this way - homosexual. Do you agree with that?\nNowhere in the Bible does it say God made anyone homosexual. There are verses that seem to indicate that some people may be attracted to the same sex but there is nothing about God making anyone that way.\nIt says repent or burn in hell. What if I don't believe in hell?\nThink about it logically. If you aren't afraid of burning in hell for eternity, why would you not do good? If you don't believe in God, then you aren't going to burn in hell. It really is that simple. The very fact that you are asking questions about God leads me to believe that you already know there is one. You just don't want to admit it to yourself.\nNo one is perfect, we all sin, and will die.

Now you will be leading a team where there are no women at all. It is only natural that you are feeling uncomfortable about it. But this is not your fault. The tech industry, in general, is still a boys club. This is problem of the whole society, not just you or your company. You can’t fix this problem by yourself. But you can do something about it. At least in your company.\nYou don’t say who your superior is, but assuming that he is also a technical person, you can try to discuss this with him in a technical way. Imagine that you have two candidates. One is Jane, who has similar skills and experience as one of your current employees. The other one is John, but John lacks some skills which your employee has. Which one should you hire? Technically, it doesn’t really matter who you hire. But you might want to have more diversity in your team. That’s why you prefer to hire women.\nTell your boss that you know that your team will still be all men, but at least you tried to hire more women. If he has any objection to that, you can tell him that he has been fighting for gender equality himself. He represents diversity on his team. So he should understand how important it is to hire diverse people.\nThere is another, maybe even better reason to hire more women than men.

The ad read something like this: “Come visit our friendly neighborhood pot shop today!” It made me wonder just how much of a “friendly” neighborhood marijuana is actually creating. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that most Americans (52%) believe that marijuana use should be made legal while 45% say it should not be legal. This seems to indicate that there is an even split between those for and against legalization. However, when I look at social media, I see no shortage of pro-marijuana legalization articles and memes being shared. And indeed, support for marijuana legalization has been steadily growing over the last few years. I find it hard to believe that we are currently at an even split, so who is correct? Is marijuana use really harmless? In my opinion, marijuana use should not be legalized for recreational purposes.\nThere are many reasons why people choose to use marijuana. Some people use marijuana as a form of pain management, others use it to help them sleep, some use it to help relieve stress or anxiety, and many others use it for fun.

Still, no other headphone does such an excellent job at blocking out background noise, and those who want the best noise cancelling performance should consider these.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM2 are the best noise cancelling headphones and earphones we've tested so far. They're comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time, and their over-ear design ensures they won't fall out even during strenuous exercise. Their audio reproduction is also very good, especially since they come with a great active EQ that adjusts the sound based on your headphones environment.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Dopamine levels do not fluctuate as much as serotonin (5-HT) levels. The amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft changes only with the amount of dopamine released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, which depends on how many dopamine receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter.\nThe actual release of dopamine is less than 1% of the total amount that was stored in vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, measuring brain dopamine levels would require the injection of extremely large amounts of dopamine into the brain to measure any change in brain levels. Also, dopamine is widely distributed in the brain and has multiple functions which vary depending on its location. For example, high levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex have been associated with reduced impulsivity, while high levels in the striatum are associated with reduced motor activity."

Starting with C, the first note of the C scale, there are three ways to play C: C, C# (D♭), and C♮ (D). Continuing up the scale, each note has three more possibilities, giving us:\n\nC, D, E, F, G, A, B, C♯, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭, C\nThen going back down, we get:\n\nC, B♭, A♭, G♭, F♭, E♭, D♭, C♯, B, A, G, F, E, D, C\nAnd going back up again:\n\nC, B, A, G, F, E, D, C♯, B♯, A♯, G♯, F♯, E♯, D♯, C\nSo there are 12 different notes when starting on C, and any time you transpose a note by a semitone, you have another note. This gives us 36 different notes per octave.\nIf we start on any other note, say A, then the first three notes are:\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A\nTransposing up and down from A gives us all the other keys as well.\nThis means that if we were to play a major or minor chord with every note in the octave, it would take 36 x 36 = 12"

As others have mentioned, most of your corrosion will be where the road salt is directly touching the metal, and not where the salt is dripping down from above. For maximum benefit, you want to maximize the surface area of your sacrificial anode (and thus the amount of electrons it can give up). To do this without modifying the car, you could attach strips of aluminum to the bottom of the tires (or put some kind of skid-plate under them), and also coat/paint the inside of any wheel wells (where the road salt tends to collect) as well. $\\endgroup$ – Ben Crowell Mar 11 '17 at 0:42\nThe idea is sound: the sacrificial anode will corrode instead of the car. However, there are two problems with your proposed method:\nThe first problem is that, while driving, the underside of the car will be exposed to much less road salt than when parked. Thus, on average, the anode will corrode more slowly. This means that it will eventually fail before the car itself.\nThe"
