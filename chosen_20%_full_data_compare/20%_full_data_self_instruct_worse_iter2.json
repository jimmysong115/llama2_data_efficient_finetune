Itâs not only highly addictive and gripping, but it pays attention to the smallest of details in storytelling and character development. When I recently decided to make a review of every season, I knew that I wanted to start with the first, as it is most often considered the âworstâ of the bunch, even though I donât think it is at all. This is mainly due to the fact that nothing happens in this season, that it mostly acts as a set-up. I always found this to be a bit unfair, because while it does act as a set-up, it also has some fantastic storytelling within itself, and sets up everything brilliantly.\nBreaking Bad (TV Series 2008â2013) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\nBreaking Bad (TV Series 2008â2013) cast and crew credits, including actors, actresses, directors, writers and more.\nBreaking Bad Season 1 Episode 1 Review - YouTube\n4/11/2017 Â· Breaking Bad: Season 1 Review.

So when you do str1 == str2, it actually checks for the reference equality. That is, it checks if both the variables point to the same string object in the heap. If it does, then they are equal. If not, then they aren't.\nHowever, this has a drawback. Two different strings can have the same content but may be stored in different memory locations (i.e., the memory address of the string object). For example, consider the following code:\nString str1 = \"hey\";\nString str2 = \"hey\";\nSystem.out.println(str1 == str2); // true\nAs you see, both variables point to the same string object in the heap. However, what happens if you modify one of them?\nString str3 = \"hey\";\nString str4 = \"hey\";\nSystem.out.println(str1 == str3); // false\nBecause now str1 and str3 point to two different objects in the heap.\nTo overcome this, java provides the equals() method which checks for value equality. The equals() method checks if two strings have the same content - that is, if they contain the same characters in the same order. If so, then they're equal.\nSo to summarize, use == for"

It works by measuring the amount of light that is scattered by the coffee beans. The more dense the beans are, the less light will pass through them. This means that darker beans will scatter less light than lighter beans. To build a coffee darkness meter, you will need:\n- A light source such as a bright LED or a candle\n- A piece of cardboard or paper to act as a shield for the light source\n- A container to hold the coffee beans\n- A way to measure the amount of scattered light, such as a photodiode or a photomultiplier tube\n- A way to display the results, such as a LCD screen or a simple digital display\nInstructions:\n1. Connect the photodiode or photomultiplier tube to a signal processor that can convert the light intensity into a digital value.\n2. Place the container with the coffee beans in front of the light source, with the cardboard or paper shielding it from the light.\n3. Start the measurement and record the initial light intensity.\n4. Add one coffee bean to the container and wait for the light intensity to stabilize.\n5. Record the new light intensity and calculate the percentage of decrease in light intensity.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with increasing numbers of coffee beans until you have a dataset that covers the range of darkness levels for coffee beans.\n7. Use a linear regression algorithm to fit a line to the data and calculate the intercept and slope of the line.\n8. Divide the x-axis scale of your graph by the slope of the line to get a logarithmic scale.\n9. Plot the data points on the logarithmic scale and draw a straight line through them.\n"

To do so, we will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text and extract meaningful information. We will then compare the extracted information to a predefined set of rules to determine the appropriate category for the tweet.\nEvent Classification\nTo classify a tweet as an event, we need to look for specific keywords that indicate that the tweet is related to a social or public happening. Some examples of these keywords include âconcert,â âfestival,â ârally,â âparty,â and âsymposium.â We can also leverage location-based information to determine if the tweet is related to an event in a specific city or country.\nDemo Classification\nFor demo classification, we need to look for keywords that indicate that the tweet is related to a public showing or presentation of something. This could include words like âexhibition,â âdemo,â âshowcase,â or âlaunch.â We can also use sentiment analysis to determine if the tweet is positive or negative, and use that information to classify the tweet as a demo.\nNews Classification\nTo classify a tweet as news, we need to look for keywords that indicate that the tweet is related to recent events or happenings. These keywords could include ânews,â âupdate,â âbreaking,â or âalert.â We can also use sentiment analysis to determine if the tweet is positive or negative, and use that information to classify the tweet as news.\nPredefined Rules\nTo classify a tweet into one of the three categories, we need to define a set of predefined rules. For example, if a tweet includes the word âconcertâ along with location information, we can classify it as an event. Similarly, if a tweet includes the word âdemo"

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
