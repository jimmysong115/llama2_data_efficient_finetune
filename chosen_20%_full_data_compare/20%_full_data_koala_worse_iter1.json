They are also doing things like Chromebooks, which can actually help low income consumers.\n2) Microsoft - While their policies towards their own ecosystem aren't always great, they have been working on making Xbox more accessible to everyone including those who can't afford it. They have also been increasingly embracing cross-platform play and have been improving the Xbox app for Windows 10.\n3) Nintendo - Because of their current success with the Switch (which is a heck of a lot more consumer friendly than the Wii U), but if we consider their history, Nintendo has always been a company that is very protective of the consumer's experience.\n4) Sony - There is a reason why their consoles are so expensive, they don't need to discount them or embark on sales like the competition does. It's because they know their products are high quality and will sell regardless of price. Also, PS Now is a nice way for consumers to get access to older games without having to buy an entire console just for 1 or 2 games.\n5) EA - While they aren't the worst publisher out there, they clearly prioritize profit over everything else. A good example of that is how Origin works. They lock their PC gamers into their platform even when other digital distributors are providing better prices for the same games.\nIt should be noted that all of these companies have made moves in the right direction or have shown"

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

A plant manager leans on the OR guy when he has a problem and needs help. – Daniel Earwicker Sep 7 '15 at 14:21\nHow long do you see yourself working for a company before moving up to COO? Different companies have different paths to the top. At the two largest corporations I worked for, there was no clear path except the CEO wanted someone who had worked their way up through the ranks. I assume your goal is to be CEO one day. If so, your time as a \"worker bee\" is limited. The clock starts ticking when you graduate from college. – HLGEM Sep 7 '15 at 14:45\nIf you can prove you work well with your hands you may find a place in aerospace or automotive where they still prefer people from the trades to manage production.

However, when it comes to circles, the formula for calculating perimeter gets a little more involved. Instead of adding the lengths of the sides, we add the lengths of the \"segments\" that make up the circumference of the circle. The formula for the circumference of a circle (or the length of its \"segment\") is given by the equation C = 2 * pi * r, where C is the circumference, pi is approximately equal to 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle. The formula for the area of a circle is A = pi * r^2, where A is the area of the circle and r is the radius of the circle. So how do we relate the area and perimeter of a circle? If you double the radius of a circle, the area will increase by a factor of four but the perimeter will increase by a factor of eight."

When you inhale cold air, the airways in your lungs constrict temporarily, causing a brief sensation of chest tightness or discomfort. In response, your body begins to warm the air as it flows into your lungs by increasing blood flow to the area. This increase in blood flow triggers an increase in body temperature, which can make you feel warmer.\nWhy does my body get warm when I exercise?\nYour muscles require more energy than at rest, so they break down glycogen — stored glucose in your muscles and liver — for fuel during exercise. As this happens, lactic acid builds up in your muscles. The higher your intensity and the longer you exercise, the more lactic acid builds up. Lactic acid is what causes that burning feeling in your muscles. Your body then shuttles the lactic acid to your liver, where it’s processed and converted back to glucose so your muscles have enough energy to keep moving.\nScientists say there are two main reasons for this: one is to allow your body to maintain its core temperature, and the other is to prevent dehydration. Some people find they sweat more when they’re anxious, but this isn’t necessarily true for everyone.\nWhy we sweat when we are nervous?\nHeat stroke occurs when your body is unable to regulate its own temperature and your temperature rises rapidly. Heat stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Symptoms include a high body temperature, hot and dry skin,"

As a native Arizonan, I had the opportunity to spend several summers living and working in Flagstaff, and my experiences there have left a lasting impression on me.\nOne of the most striking features of Flagstaff is its breathtaking natural beauty. The city is surrounded by towering mountains, including the iconic San Francisco Peaks, which rise to an elevation of over 12,000 feet. These mountains provide endless opportunities for hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities. In fact, one of my favorite memories from my time in Flagstaff was hiking to the top of Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona, and watching the sunrise from the summit.\nAnother aspect of Flagstaff that stood out to me was its tight-knit community. Despite being a relatively small city, Flagstaff has a strong sense of community pride and a deep connection to its history. One example of this is the historic downtown area, which has been carefully restored and preserved over the years. Another is the local arts scene, which features a variety of galleries, museums, and performance venues showcasing the work of talented local artists.\nHowever, Flagstaff is not without its challenges. Like many cities in the American West, it faces issues related to water management and conservation. Additionally, the city's location at high elevation puts it at risk for air pollution and wildfires. These challenges are exacerbated by its proximity to nearby national forests, which provide ample opportunity for outdoor recreation but also make it easier for fires"

make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

        "input": "",
        "output": "Carbon Fibres are used in the Building Construction Industry to create composites that are extremely lightweight, high strength and have very good thermal properties. Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are often used for structural members such as columns, beams and flooring and can provide a 40% weight saving over traditional steel or aluminium options. Carbon fibres are also used for insulation purposes where their high thermal resistance characteristics are beneficial.\nWhat building materials are made of recycled materials?\nRecycled materials are used in many different forms of construction including bricks, drywall, concrete, and even lumber. Recycled plastic lumber is an increasingly popular material for decking, fencing, and other outdoor applications. In addition to saving resources by reusing existing materials, these green building materials help to reduce the carbon footprint of construction.\nHow are carbon fibers made?\nCarbon fibers are made from polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which is derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. The process to make carbon fibers begins with the purification of raw materials using solvents. These materials are then placed in cylindrical vessels and put under extreme heat and pressure to produce long, thin threads of the material. Finally, these threads are treated with chemicals to enhance their electrical conductivity and make them more durable.\nWhy do buildings collapse when there is an earthquake?\nBuildings collapse mainly due to the failure of unreinforced masonry walls, weak columns and foundations, improper construction, and poor quality control during construction. During an earthquake, the shaking causes excessive forces to act on the structure, leading to failure. The failure mode can be due to overturning, flexure, shear, or a combination"

Frum has been highly critical of Trump and says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so you’d be forgiven for thinking Obama and Frum would have little in common.\nBut they had plenty to chat about.

Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.
