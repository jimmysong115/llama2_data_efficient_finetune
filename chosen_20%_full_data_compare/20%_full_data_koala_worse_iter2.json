In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

        "output": "\nWhy can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?\nThe reason is that it is not possible to precisely value the assets on a bank's balance sheet, so regulators impose a minimum requirement for how much cash a bank must hold as a buffer against losses. This is called the liquidity ratio and it varies from country to country but typically ranges from 10%-25%. If a bank holds more than this amount, then it is considered to be hoarding cash which could be used elsewhere in the economy."

They don't force you to use any of their products, and in fact they offer a lot of them for free (e.g. Gmail, YouTube, Maps).\nMicrosoft used to be considered anti-consumer because of their proprietary software and high prices. However, they've changed a lot in recent years and now offer many of their products for free or at low cost, while also offering more flexibility in how you use them.\nNintendo is probably the least pro-consumer company on this list. They have a very strict control over what you can and cannot do with their products, and they limit your ability to resell them. They also often release games that are not very user-friendly or have bugs that make them unplayable.\nSony has been both pro- and anti-consumer at different times. They used to be notorious for not allowing you to play used games on their consoles, but they've since backed off on that. They also used to make you pay a fee every time you wanted to buy an online game, but now they've dropped that as well.\nEA is another company that's been criticized for being anti-consumer due to their strict controls over their games and high prices. However, they've also made some moves recently to be more consumer-friendly, such as removing the always-online requirement for their latest game SimCity."

Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

He had always felt different from other half-elves, with a deep sense of isolation and otherness. As he grew older, he began to hear whispers in his dreams, calling to him from beyond the veil. Determined to uncover the truth, he set out on a journey, following the whispers to the far reaches of the land.\nHe eventually came across an ancient temple, long abandoned but still imbued with the power of the rift. Inside, he found a hidden chamber, where he discovered a magical artifact much like the one that had corrupted Rayson so long ago.

Diabetes can lead to kidney damage over time, which is what we see with CKD. Insulin is very effective at helping control blood sugar levels. At some point, most individuals with diabetes who develop CKD will require insulin. The decision to initiate insulin therapy can be a difficult one for both the patient and physician. Ultimately, we would like to delay dialysis for as long as possible, and insulin can help us achieve this goal.\nI recommend speaking with your nephrologist about starting insulin. They may recommend an oral medication first. If your A1c is above 8%, then insulin should be considered. Once insulin therapy is started, we can try to use the least amount of insulin needed to control your blood sugar levels. This can usually be achieved with either once or twice daily injections. Insulin is also available as a pump, which may be a good option for some patients. I recommend working closely with your healthcare team to determine if insulin therapy is right for you."

        "output": "Historically, pipelines have been built across the US without any government intervention. In fact, many of the oil pipelines that currently exist were built by private companies before the existence of governmental regulatory agencies. However, today, some people are concerned about the environmental impact of building new pipelines and other infrastructure related to fossil fuel production. As a result, some politicians have proposed legislation that would affect whether or not pipelines could be built. For example, in 2017, President Trump issued an executive order that expedited the approval process for the construction of pipelines. This was done in part to support the oil industry, which is an important source of jobs and revenue for the US. Others opposed this action because they thought it was bad for the environment."

It estimates that there may be as many as 20,000 - 50,000 such civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy alone.\nHere are some of the parameters of the Drake equation:\n1. R*: the rate of formation of stars that have planetary systems\n2. fp: the fraction of those planetary systems with planets that could support life\n3. Ne: the number of planets in the habitable zone of a star\n4. fl: the fraction of habitable planets where life actually emerges\n5. fi: the fraction of planets where life actually develops intelligence\n6. fc: the fraction of planets where developed civilizations appear\n7. L: the length of time a civilization releases detectable signals into space\nThe error margins for these parameters vary widely depending on the source. For example, some experts estimate that the error margins for R* and fp could be as high as 100 times their respective values. However, other experts believe that the error margins for these parameters are much smaller, perhaps only a factor of 2 or 3.\nIf we use the upper and lower bounds for each parameter, the result of the Drake equation would look like this:\nN = R* * fp * Ne * fl * fi * fc * L\nUpper bound: N = 100,000\nLower bound: N = 2,000\nTherefore, the estimated number of detectable, communicative civilizations in our galaxy could be anywhere from 2,000 to 100,000."

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

        "output": "The book Upstream is about how to create “a world-shaping movement of small changes.” The author, Dan Heath, makes the case that systems in nature and society are designed by individuals with self-interest. He offers three strategies for overcoming this self-interest: “Create a Surplus, Broaden Our Narrow Focus, and Shape Incentives.” \nFor Visalia Unified School District’s team of Social Workers, the first strategy (Create a Surplus) is of particular relevance. A surplus can be generated by creating programs and services that provide value to participants. For the School Social Workers, they generate a surplus by providing those they work with a sense of hope. The current mental health crisis among our youth requires new ideas from all of us, but especially those working directly with them. This crisis has been characterized as an epidemic with 1 in 6 children and adolescents being affected. Additionally, suicide rates have doubled among teens in the last decade. Clearly, we must implement ideas that generate a surplus to curb the mental health crisis.\nOne such idea is the implementation of more intensive home visiting and in-school supports for those experiencing trauma. For example, peer-to-peer support groups in schools can generate a surplus through the decrease in bullying, increase in student attendance, and improved academic performance. These supports are directly tied to the trauma informed care model. The model focuses on treating the symptoms of untreated trauma. The symptoms include things like aggression, disengagement, substance abuse, and lack of trust. This is a powerful approach where adults listen to students, and student leaders are developed.\nAnother form of generating a surplus is by helping students overcome poverty related risk factors such as lack of food, clean water"

Carbon Fibers have a lot of strength and stiffness in little mass, so they’re an amazing materials for structural functions. A carbon fiber can help stretch the extent of a concrete slab or maintain a bridge column upright.\nA key characteristic of carbon fibers is their ability to withstand large amounts of pressure without ripping. They will resist breaking when subjected to forces like wind or seismic exercise. They are additionally sturdy against corrosion and rust, which makes them perfect for outside purposes.\nCarbon fibers are also used for architectural capabilities. Architects use them for roofing and facade cladding, as they may be very light-weight and inflexible. Furthermore, they could act as a heat sink, dissipating warmth from the within of a constructing to the skin.\nCarbon fibers have many benefits for the building industry, together with excessive strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to corrosion and rust, and the power to resist large amounts of pressure. They are additionally low cost, making them an reasonably priced option for builders. Because of these benefits, the usage of carbon fibers in the building industry is increasing."

        "output": "<br>Let us consider the amount of money he has at the beginning as x.<br>The price of the old car decreases by 1.5% per month.<br>So, after `n` months, the price of the car will be (1.5/100)^n times the initial price.<br>Similarly, the price of the new car decreases by 0.5% per month.<br>So, after `m` months, the price of the car will be (0.5/100)^m times the initial price.<br>We know that the total money he will have to pay for both the cars is equal to the cost of the old car plus the cost of the new car.<br>So, we can write an equation :<br>x = Total money available<br>1.5^(n)x + 0.5^(m)x = Cost of the old car<br>1.5^(n)x + 0.5^(m)x = Cost of the new car<br>Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get :<br>0.5^(m)x = (Cost of the new car – Cost of the old car)<br>Taking logarithm on both sides, we get :<br>m = log(0.5^(m)x/[1.5^(n)x + 0.5^(m)x])<br>Now, we have two equations in two variables. Solving these equations, we get :<br>n = 6.5<br>m = 7.8<br>So, the man will take 7.8 months to save up enough money to buy the car he wants.<br>He will have $2300 left over with him.<br>"
