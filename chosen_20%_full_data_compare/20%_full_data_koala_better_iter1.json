The user has noted which movies are available for download from the Internet Archive. Clicking on the title of the movie will take you to its listing at the Archive.\nNote that this is just a list of links, not a list of actual movies.\nCopyright law changed significantly between 1923 and 1978, so many movies that were once presumed to be in the public domain have turned out to be still protected. Some of the movies listed above may have had their copyright renewed. Check for each specific movie to determine its current status.\nIt would be helpful if you provided more specific criteria for what you're looking for. What types of movies? Genres? Specific time period? Budget? Type of work (i.e. feature vs. serial vs. short)?\nI don't know how long it will take you to sift through all these, but you could start with a few of the ones that interest you most and do a little research on your own. For example, for each one, check the imdb page and look for reviews and user comments that mention things like \"public domain\" or \"available for free\". Or try searching for the actual title on archive.org without quotes (e.g. \"the general\") to find fan-made dvds that have been released."

In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created to provide electricity to areas of Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The TVA built dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries to create hydroelectric power. These dams not only provided electricity but also helped control flooding and provide recreational opportunities such as fishing and boating.\nToday, there are over 80,000 dams in the United States that provide power, irrigation, flood control, and recreation. However, dams also pose risks. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the levees and drainage systems of New Orleans, Louisiana. This led to widespread flooding and the deaths of over 1,800 people. Water safety engineering projects aim to prevent or minimize these types of disasters by taking into account the risks associated with water and using engineering solutions to mitigate those risks.\nOne example of a water safety engineering project is the creation of a dam break emergency plan. A dam break occurs when the failure of a dam releases a large amount of water suddenly. This can cause severe flooding downstream. To prepare for this type of emergency, a dam break emergency plan should be created that includes evacuation routes, emergency contact information, and instructions for turning off utilities. The plan should also include a communication system to alert people downstream of the potential danger.\nAnother example of a water safety engineering project is the construction of levees around cities to protect against flooding. Levees are walls or embankments that are built around low-lying areas to"

Here are some ways to leverage human knowledge to improve instance segmentation AP metrics:\n1) Use human annotated bounding boxes: Provide humans with the images with their ground truth segmentation masks and ask them to provide the bounding boxes for each object in the image. These boxes can then be used to train an instance segmentation model.\n2) Use bounding box predictions from a person in the loop: Ask a human to provide the bounding boxes for objects in the image and use these boxes as initial guesses for the instance segmentation model. The model's predictions can then be refined using these initial guesses.\n3) Use labels from a human in the loop: Ask a human to provide the segmentation masks for objects in the image and use these masks to train an instance segmentation model.\n4) Use domain specific knowledge: If you have expert knowledge about the domain of the images, such as knowing which objects are likely to appear in the images, you can use this knowledge to improve instance segmentation performance. For example, if you know that certain types of cars are likely to appear in the images, you can train a model to recognize those car models.\n5) Use transfer learning: Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a related task, such as object detection, and fine-tuning it for instance segmentation.

In contrast, self-sufficient living spaces mean that you are able to provide for your basic needs – food, water, shelter and energy – without having to depend on outside resources.\nHere’s what you need to know about creating a self-sufficient living space:\n1. Solar power is one of the most reliable renewable energy sources you can use to power your home. Solar energy is created from the sun’s radiation, which produces electricity that can be used to power homes. The key components of a solar power system include solar panels, batteries, and an inverter. Solar panels collect the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity, while batteries store the energy for later use. An inverter converts the direct current (DC) electricity produced by the solar panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in your home.\n2. Wind power is another reliable renewable energy source that can be used to power your home. Wind turbines are installed on your property to generate electricity. Wind turbines work by using the wind’s kinetic energy to spin a generator, which produces electricity. The key components of a wind power system include wind turbines, batteries, and an inverter.\n3. Hydro power is a renewable energy source that can be generated from moving water, such as rivers or streams. A hydro power system includes a turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. The key components of a hydro power system include a dam, turbine, and generator.\n4.

For example, if you bet your own money on a coin toss, you are said to have skin in the game. If you bet someone else’s money, you don’t have skin in the game, but rather are saying to yourself, “I’m taking risks with this other guy’s money, so I better be careful.”\nWhy should this matter? Because, according to Taleb, randomness is part of life. There is no way to predict the future. So if you’re relying on predictions about the future to make investment decisions, you will often be wrong.\nThose without skin in the game tend to ignore randomness and the mistakes they made because they didn’t lose their own money. They just repeat the same mistakes over and over again, hanging onto the illusion that they are clever.\nIn contrast, those who have skin in the game face reality. They learn from their mistakes, adapt, and become successful.\nRead More: What is the Kelly Criterion?\nTaleb was an options trader before becoming a professor at New York University.

Additionally, photography has taught me the importance of patience, perseverance, and attention to detail, all critical skills for success in any field.\n\nI am inspired by the work of many talented photographers, such as Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Dorothea Lange, whose images have captured important moments in history and left a lasting impact on our world.

If you’re looking for a high quality, long lasting chain that will give your jewelry an elegant look, a 925 sterling silver Miami Cuban link chain is a great choice. However, the price tag can be tough to swallow. Here is some information about Miami Cuban link chains and how to choose one.\nChoose the right width Xinrui The width of the chain refers to the distance between each link. Most people choose a chain with a medium width because it is versatile and looks good with most types of charms and pendants. However, if you want your chain to really stand out, you can choose a narrow or wide width chain. Also consider the thickness of the links when choosing a width. Thinner links will show more detail on your charms, while thicker links may look better if you want a simple, classic look.\nAvoid cheap material You might be tempted to buy a Cuban link chain made of gold or platinum, but they are extremely expensive. Instead, buy a high quality 925 sterling silver chain. This is a very durable metal that won’t tarnish, and it is much less expensive than other precious metals. If you want a golden or rose gold look, try using a plating process instead of buying a solid gold or rose gold chain.\nConsider the length Many people choose a 20 inch (51 cm) chain, but you can get a shorter or longer chain if you prefer. A shorter chain will look best with a pendant, while a longer chain adds visual interest to a necklace with no pendant. Try on several chains at different lengths to see which one you like best."

The idea behind dry hopping is to allow the hops to fully express their essential oils and acids, which can be easily lost during the boil.\nThe dry hop process adds an extra pop of flavor and aroma that can not be obtained from using only hop pellets or hop flowers. Dry hopping also allows for more yeast and nutrient attenuation, which results in a cleaner, more refreshing tasting beer. When are hops added to the brewing process?\nDuring the boil, hops are added to add bitterness and flavor to the wort. Hops can also be added late in the boil process, as well as just before the end of the boil, to create different hop profiles.\nAdding hops late in the boil will add more hop aroma than adding them early, but it will also increase the chances of the hops getting too hot and releasing harsh, bitter compounds. Adding hops near the beginning of the boil allows you to increase the amount of hop utilization, which will make your beer more bitter. This can be useful if you want to adjust the IBUs of your beer after it has been fermented.\nMid-boil hopping is when you add 12 to 15 minutes into the boil.\nLate hop additions are usually made within the last 10 minutes of the boil.\nThe longer the hops are left in the boil, the more alpha acids are released, which will contribute to increased bitterness. Additionally, the more hop oils that are released, the more aromatic your beer will be. This is why"

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

Some of these include chronicling important events for future generations to learn from, preserving cultural traditions and practices, and even just for personal reflection and memory. Documenting history is an important part of understanding where we've come from and how far we've progressed as a society, and it serves as a foundation for us to build upon in the future.\nIn many ways, history can be seen as a continuous cycle of progress and regress, with each era learning from the mistakes of those who came before while building on the successes. By documenting the past, we ensure that future generations are able to benefit from our knowledge and avoid repeating the same mistakes. This is especially true when it comes to political and social issues, such as discrimination, war, and inequality. By recording and studying these events, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just society.\nFurthermore, documenting history allows us to preserve cultural traditions and practices that may otherwise be lost over time. These traditions often hold great significance for the people who practice them and can help foster a sense of identity and community. By documenting them, we can ensure that they are passed down to future generations and continue to be a part of our collective heritage.\nFinally, documenting history can also serve as a source of personal reflection and memory. Many people use journals, diaries, and other forms of writing to record their experiences and emotions, which can be incredibly valuable for understanding oneself and one's place in the world. By documenting our own lives and sharing them with others, we create a sort of historical record that can be studied and learned from by future generations.\nIn conclusion, documenting history is crucial for understanding where we've come from and how far we'"

The continent has 17% of the world’s remaining untouched airstrips and 640 million potential air travellers. However, many airlines face challenges in profitably serving the market. Infrastructure bottlenecks and inefficient processes hinder connectivity and hamper economic development,” said IATA director general and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, at the 49th IATA Annual General Meeting and World Air Transport Summit, which is being held in Johannesburg this week.\nDe Juniac told delegates that while air transport supported 6.5 million jobs and contributed $72.9bn to Africa’s economy last year, more needed to be done to improve regional connectivity.\n“The single biggest challenge to expanding air transport connectivity is the lack of infrastructure at many regional airports. Only 38% of the 5 000 airfields in Africa have paved runways, which limits their use by larger aircraft. For example, fewer than 2 000 airfields are certified to international safety standards. This restricts airline operations and means that just 2% of domestic African air travel is by jet aircraft. Governments must invest in building or upgrading airport infrastructure to make it possible for airlines to link more cities with larger planes. Paved runways, navigation aids and adequate customs facilities would enable more traffic and boost tourism,” he said.\nThe second major challenge is inefficient border management, according to de Juniac.\n“Border agencies need to implement global"

Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n",
        "input": "",
        "output": "A: A double pane window may be more efficient than a triple pane window, but it depends on the climate and other factors. \nTo compare the energy efficiency of different window designs, we can use the U-factor as a measure. The U-factor is a measure of how well a material or material assembly (e.g., a window) insulates against heat flow. The lower the U-factor, the better the insulation performance.\nThe U-factor for single, double, and triple panes of glass vary depending on the climate and other factors, but here are some general guidelines:\nIn cold climates (i.e., where heating is required for most of the year), triple pane windows typically have a lower U-factor than double pane windows. This is because the additional pane of glass provides more insulation against heat loss.\nIn warm climates (i.e., where air conditioning is required for most of the year), double pane windows with a low-e coating may be more efficient than triple pane windows without a low-e coating. The additional pane of glass in the triple pane window would increase the solar heat gain coefficient (SGHC), which would result in more heat gain in the summer.\nHowever, it's important to note that other factors besides U-factor and SGHC can affect the energy efficiency of windows, such as air leakage, window frame material, and window size. Therefore, it's best to consult with an experienced professional in the field to determine the most energy-efficient windows for a specific location and climate."

Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, By Benyamin Kahane. pp.\nBenny Kahane's book, The Ethics of Violence: The Case of Palestine, is a remarkable achievement. It is also an aberration, as it stands alone among writings on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as both a rigorous philosophical treatise and a passionate defense of the use of force by one side in that conflict. To say that this book is intellectually bold is an understatement. The author, whose life ended tragically in the midst of writing it, takes on the political orthodoxies of both sides and offers a daring argument for the ethical legitimacy of violence against the other side. He bravely challenges taboos on both sides and succeeds in developing a coherent moral philosophy that is uncomfortable to all but the most steadfast ideologues.\nIn this book, Kahane provides a compelling analysis of the situation and offers cogent arguments for his thesis. In opposing the view that violence is always to be condemned, he draws on the works of Hegel, Maimonides, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and others. His essay is not only thought provoking but will undoubtedly evoke strong feelings from those who read it. This book examines issues of morality, statecraft, and international relations.\nIt is a timely contribution to the debate about the ethics of using force in a world where the use of violence seems to be increasing.

Duck typing means that if an object responds to methods with expected properties, then it should be treated as an instance of that object. In this example, the `area` function expects two properties from an object: `width` and `height` for `Rectangle` and `radius` for `"

However, I can provide you with some basic information about the disease.\nSarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects multiple organs in the body. The exact cause of the disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an overactive immune system. The disease is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small clusters of inflamed cells. These granulomas can form in any part of the body, including the lungs, skin, eyes, heart, brain, and kidneys.\nSymptoms of sarcoidosis can vary depending on which organs are affected. In some cases, the disease may not cause any symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, they may include:\n- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin\n- Fatigue and generalized weakness\n- Skin rashes, most commonly on the face or hands\n- Red and itchy eyes\n- Shortness of breath or coughing\n- Chest pain or heart palpitations\n- Nodules in the fingers or toes\n- Cloudy sensation in the eyes\n- Muscle weakness or joint pain\nIf you have any concerns about your health or symptoms that you believe may be related to sarcoidosis, it is important to seek medical attention from a qualified healthcare professional.

An agent can be rational even if their goals are irrational, in which case they will make decisions that other agents would consider crazy, like sacrificing their health or their children’s futures for short-term pleasures. Even when acting rationally, agents may have conflicting goals and may not believe the same things, so there is no basis for claims that one agent’s beliefs are rational while another’s are not. For instance, a utilitarian may think that torturing one person to save five is rational, while a deontologist would find it immoral.\nThe concept of rationality has different meanings in philosophy, psychology, logic, and economics. In philosophy, rationality refers to the use of reason to arrive at true conclusions. In psychology and logic, it refers to making correct choices on the basis of one’s reasons. In economics, rationality implies that the individual acts in a way that maximizes his or her utility.\nHow do you know if your beliefs are rational?\nWhen evaluating whether one’s beliefs are rational, several factors must be taken into account: One’s goals, desires, and values, as well as what one believes about the world and how one goes about achieving one’s goals. Sometimes the question is raised whether an agent is rational if she holds two contradictory beliefs, such as “God exists” and “God does not exist”. This article discusses some questions about rationality, but it is not meant as a comprehensive survey of all issues surrounding rationality.\nSuppose that two people desire to maximize utility and only act on the basis of their beliefs.
