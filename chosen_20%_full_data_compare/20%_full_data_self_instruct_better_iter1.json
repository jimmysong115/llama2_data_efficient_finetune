It's like they took all the best parts out and replaced them with boring political intrigue and pointless subplots.\"\n\nI feel this way because I am a fan of Tolkien's works, and after watching the first two episodes of the series, I was hoping for an adaption that would be true to the spirit of the books. Instead, we get a very watered down version of what makes Tolkien's world so great, with characters that are barely recognizable from their source material, and a plot that feels like it's just going through the motions.\n\nBut perhaps this is the point. Maybe the showrunners realize that people like me are looking for a faithful adaption, and so they're trying to subvert our expectations by creating something that is not only different from the books, but also (in my opinion) inferior to them.\n\nIf this is the case, then I have to ask: Why? Why create a new work that is so obviously inferior to its source material? Why not just make a completely new fantasy series, one that is unencumbered by the expectations of fans like me?\n\nMaybe the answer lies in the fact that there is no such thing as a fresh idea anymore. Everything has been done before, and we know it. So when a new work comes along that tries to rehash something that's already been done, we can't help but compare it to the original. And if it falls short, we're bound to be disappointed.\nSo maybe the real question here is: How do we move beyond this cycle of derivative works, where everything is just a rehash of something else? How do we create truly new and innovative stories that capture our imagin"

Try to understand that he might be feeling lonely and out of his comfort zone, even though it’s your trip. Start talking about what he’d like to do and try to find activities that please both of you. You could also split up some of the time, but do so in a way that makes sense logistically and doesn’t put you in separate cars.\nAs for the car, offer to pay for your half up front, and then he pays the other half once he finds his own car.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
        "output": " Mathematics has been used for art in the 20th and 21st centuries, notably by the Russian constructivists and the Polish school of mathematical graphics.\nMathematics also plays a role in the interpretation of visual art, through such topics as fractal analysis, the study of self-similarity in art, and mathematical aesthetics."

        "output": "\nFair trade has its roots in the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Fair trading organizations were set up in Europe and North America to certify that products came from free laborers. The International Fair Trade Association has traced the origins of fair trade to the early Cooperative Wholesale Society founded by Roland Hill in Taplow, England in 1844.[3] In the United States and Canada, organizations such as the Student Christian Movement and the YMCA supported cooperatives in European countries as a way to promote better prices for farmers and workers. The first fair trade store was opened in Harlem, NY in 1968 by Judson Mills, who also worked with the Catholic Worker Movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, fair trade organizations became more widespread, particularly in Europe. In the early 21st century, fair trade became more international in scope, with organizations in Japan, Korea, and other parts of Asia.\nThe concept of fair trade is based upon the idea of mutually beneficial long-term relationships between producers and consumers, not simply short-term transactions. Additionally, fair trade organizations seek to address the power imbalance between producers and buyers. The goals of fair trade organizations are to: raise the standard of living of producers; eliminate or reduce the exploitation of producers; assist producers in gaining access to markets; ensure that producers receive the revenues necessary to invest in their future; and protect the environment and promote sustainability. Organizations also strive to empower producers through education and training.\nThere are many organizations dedicated to promoting fair trade.

Bend the wire into the shape of an 'H' with the pointy end cutting into the side of the can. Attach one end of the wire to one of the valves and the other end to a penny or washer. The penny or washer will act as a weight and help the valve open and close.\n5. Fill the can with water up to the top edge of the hole you cut earlier. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, which will create carbon dioxide gas when heated, making the water boil faster.\n6. Place a potato over one of the holes of the valve. This will act as a piston, pushing the water around the engine.\n7. Light a match and hold it near the opening of the can. When the can is hot, remove the match and quickly put it underneath the potato. The expansion of the gases created by the match will force the potato to move, thereby operating the steam engine."

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",
        "output": "\nThe researchers also found that when the young adults spent a second night in the lab with the lights dimmed, their bodies adjusted somewhat to the lower light level. The changes in blood sugar and heart rate were reduced compared with the first night. But both remained higher than they were when the participants slept in a well-lit room.\n“We know that sleep is so important for health,” Zee said. “This study shows that one aspect of sleep — the light environment — is not benign.”\nAni Manjikiani, an assistant professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, called it “very interesting.”\n“There are other studies that have looked at sleep and glucose metabolism, but this is the first time I’ve seen them looking at sleep and heart rate variability,” Manjikiani said.\nHeart rate variability refers to the variations in the time between each heartbeat. A person’s overall heart rate variability is influenced by factors such as age, physical fitness and emotional state. Higher overall heart rate variability has been associated with better outcomes, including survival after a heart attack and improved cardiovascular health after reperfusion of the heart following a heart attack. Lower heart rate variability has been linked to increased risk of death and heart disease.\n“It makes sense physiologically that if you have less variability, your body is not very good at recovering from stressors,” Manjikiani said.\nZee said she thinks the results could extend to all types of light — not just the light produced by TV sets and computer screens. And the findings likely apply equally to children and older adults, she said.\n“Light at night can disrupt circadian rhythms, which are important across the life"

In summary, they are:\nAutonomy – the desire to direct our own lives\nMastery – the urge to get better and better at things\nPurpose – the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves\nI’d like to suggest a simple training challenge that addresses all three of these factors on Strava. My idea is to create an event called “The 50/12 Challenge”, where participants would attempt to ride 50 miles or run 12 miles in under two hours on a specific day. Here are some reasons why I think this is a good idea:\n1. Autonomy – participants can choose when they want to complete the challenge, as long as it’s within a month. They can also choose whether to do it on a road bike or a mountain bike, or on foot.\n2. Mastery – the challenge requires a reasonable level of fitness, but it’s not so difficult that it’s impossible for most people. By setting a time limit, participants have the opportunity to improve their performance over time as their fitness increases.\n3. Purpose – the challenge has a clear goal, which serves as a motivator. Participants know that they need to complete the challenge within two hours to earn the “badge” on Strava. Additionally, completing the challenge contributes to a greater cause, such as supporting a local charity.\nOverall, the 50/12 Challenge would be a fun and engaging way to motivate people to train while also addressing key elements of motivation as described by Dan Pink."
