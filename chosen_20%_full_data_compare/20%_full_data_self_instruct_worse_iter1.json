These are not in any particular order.\nYou have two branches. One is your local branch (let's say, \"develop\") and another is a remote branch (\"remotes/origin/develop\"). Open these two branches in your editor or IDE. Now make sure both are identical. For example, if your local branch is at line 400 and remote branch is at line 399, add one more line in your local branch and push it to the remote branch.\nThis command will create a new local branch called \"merged\" which should be identical to both \"remotes/origin/develop\" and \"your-local-branch\". In my case, my local branch was \"develop\" so command would be:\n$ git checkout -b merged remotes/origin/develop develop\nNow you can commit and push your changes to the \"merged\" local branch.\nIf your local branch is already up-to-date with the remote branch (i.e., you didn't make any changes locally), you don't have to do anything. Just type:\n$ git checkout merged\nand you are done. You can now merge your local branch into the remote branch.\nYour local branch is now ready to be merged into the remote branch.\nLet's assume you want to merge \"develop\" into \"master\". Switch to \"develop\" branch and run the following commands.\n$ git checkout master\n$ git merge develop\nIn GitHub, when you try to merge a branch, it gives you two options - edit the diff and then merge or skip the editing and merge anyway.

Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Nod and smile, but don't let those expressions distract from your eyes which should be focused on their face.\nDon't be afraid to ask clarifying questions. \"Could you please explain what you mean by that?\" is a totally acceptable response, especially if you feel like you've lost the thread of what they're saying.\nStep 2: Evaluate potential impact\nAs your interviewer talks, evaluate the potential impact of their suggestion. Is it significant? Could it change the way you approach the problem?\nStep 3: Adapt your plan\nIf their idea will have a big impact, let them know you're hearing them out. \"That's a fascinating idea. I hadn't considered it before. Let me see if this adaptation makes sense.\"\nIf their idea won't change much, acknowledge it quickly then switch back to your original train of thought. \"Yeah, that's true.

It's helped me refine my thinking on the problem.\"\nIt helps to thank them even if their idea didn't make a big difference. Interviewers put a lot of work into preparing for coding interviews, and"

        "output": "\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of consumer electronics, such as the radio. The radio allowed for increased access to music as it could be broadcast to large numbers of people at once. This led to the development of new styles of music that were tailored for mass appeal. Examples of these types of music include Tin Pan Alley and Hillbilly music.\nNew media and technologies also emerged during this time that allowed for easier recording, editing, and distribution of music. The phonograph was patented in 1877 and began to be mass-produced by the beginning of the 20th century. It revolutionized the music industry by making it possible to distribute recordings of musical performances on a large scale. In the 1920s, the talking picture or \"talkie\" replaced silent films and introduced sound recording to cinema. During this period, musicians began to be paid royalties for their work, which had previously been considered an honorarium.\nThe performance of music became more visual with the advent of television and video recordings. The introduction of rock and roll culture in the 1950s made performing on stage even more important. Some performers such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles became extremely popular, selling out concerts wherever they played.\nMusic of the 20th century is often characterized by its diversity and experimentation. New styles of music called modern music were created, including atonal music, twelve-tone music, and serialism. Important composers of the 20th century included Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, John Cage, and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Jazz music developed from ragtime and blues to encompass a variety of styles generally characterized by the improvisation of soloists"

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
