        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of calories in both cakes combined and make sure it is less than or equal to the customer's budget of 600 calories. We can use a system of equations to do this:\nLet x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes.\nThen the total number of calories in one cake is:\nx * (400 calories) + y * (300 calories) = C\nThe total number of calories in two cakes is:\nx * (400 calories) + y * (300 calories) + z * (200 calories) = T\nwhere z represents the number of strawberry cakes.\nWe want to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the following system of equations:\nC = x * (400 calories) + y * (300 calories)\nT = x * (400 calories) + y * (300 calories) + z * (200 calories)\nFrom the first equation, we know that:\nx + y + z = 2 (since the customer wants to buy 2 cakes)\nFrom the second equation, we know that:\nx * (400 calories) + y * (300 calories) + z * (200 calories) = 600 (since the customer has a budget of 600 calories)\nSubstituting x + y + z = 2 into the first equation, we get:\n(x + y + z) * (400 calories) = x * (400 calories) + y * (300 calories)\nSimplifying this"

Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, have a more complex structure that allows for more specialized functions, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The evolutionary history of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is also different.

How can this technology be used to improve patient outcomes?\nBlockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving patient care, increasing data security and reducing costs. Some potential applications of blockchain technology in healthcare include:\n1. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) – Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure, decentralized EHR system that can store patient data in a tamper-proof ledger. This would enable healthcare providers to share patient information securely and quickly, without the need for manual recordkeeping or intermediaries.\n2. Medical Supply Chain Management – Blockchain can be used to track the movement of medical supplies and equipment, ensuring that they are authentic and not counterfeit. It can also help to prevent diversion of medications and supplies.\n3. Clinical Trials – Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and share clinical trial data, making it easier for researchers to collaborate and share results.\n4. Patient Identification – Blockchain can be used to create a secure, decentralized patient identification system that would enable healthcare providers to identify patients accurately and securely.\n5. Payment Processing – Blockchain technology can be used to process payments between healthcare providers and insurance companies quickly and securely, reducing administrative costs and improving cash flow.\nOverall, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling more efficient and secure sharing of patient data, reducing errors and improving patient safety."
