The bartender looks at them and says \"Aren't you a little chunky?\" $\\endgroup$\n$\\begingroup$@JohnHK already posted a great answer, but I'll add one more thing that is often helpful when learning about nuclear physics: think about analogs from everyday life. For example, when learning about the forces between nucleons, think about why two balls rolling along a pool table will eventually stop, while they'll keep rolling forever on a trampoline. Or think about why a pile driver works: it's pushing down on the tip of the pile driver with much greater force than the tiny amount of force being applied by the nails going into the wood. When you think about what's really happening in terms of the strong force, it's much easier to wrap your head around."

Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems.

For instance, a person might believe that everyone should have equal opportunities to succeed, but only apply this principle to certain groups they identify with. This type of inconsistency can be fueled by ideological thinking, where beliefs and assumptions about certain groups are used to justify discriminatory actions or policies.\nOverall, ideological thinking can create a sense of inconsistency in thinking, as people may hold beliefs that are not supported by facts or evidence, or apply different standards to different groups of people."

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",

Living in this beautiful oasis has been a dream for me and my family.   This city has many wonderful qualities that make it attractive to tourists and college students alike.  The first quality I noticed about Flagstaff was the beauty of the landscape.  With the San Francisco Peaks providing a stunning backdrop, every drive around town is scenic.  I love driving up Humphreys Peak for an astounding view of the town below.  I also enjoy going on hikes in the nearby Coconino National Forest.  It's always exciting to discover new places to explore.  Another great part of Flagstaff is how safe it is.  With a low crime rate and friendly people, this place feels like home.  Everyone here is so kind and easy going, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.  Although there aren't many big cities, there are still lots of things to do.  There are museums, restaurants, shops, and parks galore.  My favorite places are the Lowell Observatory, the Museum of Northern Arizona, and the Pulliam Airport.  One personal anecdote about living in Flagstaff is walking down Milton Road with my dog after a snow storm.  I loved seeing all the tracks our dog made in the fresh snow.

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

So, the question is, how many glass panes are optimal to maximize the energy efficiency while keeping the cost under a certain limit? To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors:\n1. The climate zone - the amount of heat loss or gain through windows depends on the climate zone.\n2. The thickness of each pane of glass - thicker glass provides better insulation, but it also increases the cost.\n3. The U-factor of the window - the lower the U-factor, the better the window is at preventing heat loss or gain.\n4. The cost of the windows - as the number of panes increases, the cost of the windows also increases.\nTo find the optimal number of glass panes, we need to balance the energy savings with the cost of the windows. We can use a linear programming approach to solve this problem. Let's assume that we have two variables, N and C, representing the number of glass panes and the cost of the windows, respectively. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (measured in terms of the U-factor) subject to a limit on the cost of the windows. The constraints are:\n1. The maximum number of glass panes is 3.\n2. The cost of the windows cannot exceed a certain limit, say Cmax.\nThe linear programming problem can be written as follows:\nMaximize U-factor Subject to Constraints:\nN ≤ 3\nC ≤ Cmax\ns.t. U-factor ≤ f(N, C)\nwhere f(N, C) is a function that takes into account the U-factor of the window as a function of the number of glass panes and the cost of"

For example, Schmitt wrote: \"The distinction between friends and enemies is the most fundamental one in political life.\" Similarly, Voegelin argued, \"political order is possible only by means of a permanent revolution which preserves the essence of society through the annihilation of its existing order.\" The ethics of violence (which he called 'civic virtues') are essential for the establishment of such a new order.

How do creatures like this work when they're the final boss of an adventure?\nDungeons &amp; Dragons: 5th Edition Monster Manual describes Frost Giants as having only a +1 bonus to Armor Class and not being immune to non-magical weapons. Since you are playing 5e I assume you are aware of the Monster Manual 2, which does list Frost Giants as having the immunity to non-magical weapons property. However, even if they had it listed in the basic D&amp;D 5e Monster Manual I wouldn't let them use non-magical weapons against a Frost Giant. Frost Giants are tough enough without making them easier to kill. The fact that Frost Giants have a high Constitution score means they are slow to kill already. As DM, I would allow any weapon the player found against a Frost Giant. Even if the weapon wasn't particularly effective against the giant, at least the player would have something to show for all their effort."
