The \"unset\" function is the simplest way to remove an element from an array. It removes the key of the specified element from the array, making it equivalent to removing the element itself.\nHere's an example of how to use the \"unset\" function:\n$array = array(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\");\nunset($array[0]);\nprint_r($array);\n// Output:\nArray\n(\n    [0] => four\n    [1] => three\n    [2] => two\n    [3] => one\n)\nThe \"splice\" function allows you to modify an array by removing an element and returning the deleted element (if it exists). It also allows you to specify which element(s) should be removed. Here's an example of how to use the \"splice\" function:\n$array = array(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\");\n$new_array"

You can even mention that you enjoyed his company for the first week and hope to stay in touch in the future. If he insists on arguing, then you are right to get away from him. Maybe he had a bad day or two and will change his behavior once he gets some space.

After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.\nWhew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.\nNow you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.\nWhen suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.\n\"What if we thought of the problem this way?\"\nYou feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:\n\"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!\"",
        "output": "\nHow can you stay focused on what your interviewer is saying, while still thinking through the implications of their suggestion? How can you confirm that you've understood them correctly (without sounding like you're not listening)? And how can you quickly switch gears in your mind to address this new angle--while still keeping the rest of your solution intact?\nIn this post, I'll give you some pointers for how to do all of this.\nLet's say you were solving the problem, and your interviewer says something like:\n\"Hmmm. Interesting. That's a good solution. But have you considered another way of looking at it?\"\nWhat happens next depends on two things:\n1. How good of an interviewee you are\n2. How well you can multitask your brain\nIf you're a good interviewee, you should just be able to slip back into the groove of solving the problem, after a brief \"huh?\" moment.\nBut if you're not so good at interviewing, or if you have a hard time keeping multiple trains of thought going at once, you might feel a little frazzled, because now you have to solve the problem in this new way as well.\nEven if you're a great interviewee, who doesn't get thrown off your game, it can be tough to keep both trains of thought going at once. In that case, here are some pointers for how to approach this conversation:\n1. Mirror their enthusiasm\nWhen people are excited about something, it's contagious. So try to match their energy level and tone, with your own:\n\"That's a cool idea! Let me see if I can apply it to my solution...\"\n2. Repeat back the essence of what they said\nAs soon as you can, repeat back the ess"

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
        "output": "\nIn the visual arts, a mathematical model is a set of assumptions about the form and appearance of a work that can be used to predict certain aspects of it. Examples include the rule of thirds in photography, the golden ratio in painting and architecture, and the modular scale in graphic design. Mathematics is also applied in the analysis of art through such disciplines as art history, conservation, computer vision, image processing, photography, and remote sensing."

Fair trade certifiers grant a premium to producers that can be used for social and economic development projects. In the United States, fair trade coffee is regulated by the Small Farmer Census and Sustainability program.\nThe fair trade movement has been criticized for being ineffective in changing global labor conditions and for reinforcing existing power structures by creating a market for niche goods rather than directly challenging those structures through more disruptive means. Critics also argue that fair trade does not address issues of economic inequality and poverty alleviation, and it may actually perpetuate dependency rather than promote self-sufficiency among producers."

        "input": "A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",
        "output": "\nThe blood sugar and heart rate increases were about the same magnitude as those seen in people with metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that together increase the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nZee’s team set out to study the role of light in sleep because previous research had suggested it might play a role in appetite regulation and metabolic health. Unlike other species, humans don’t have to survive at night; instead, they have evolved to be active during the day. But today, people spend most of their days indoors, often sitting in front of screens, which emit blue light that tricks the brain into thinking it’s still daytime. At night, many people also watch TV or read on tablets, both of which emit light that could potentially disrupt sleep.\nZee’s team wanted to see if “light pollution” from these devices was linked to the rise in modern-day chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\nTo find out, she and her team put eight young, healthy adults ages 23 to 29 through two experiments. In one, the participants slept for a night with only a small amount of light coming from a television set — about the same amount of light that may seep in from a window at night. The second experiment used a computer screen, which emits less light than a TV but more than complete darkness. Both conditions resulted in similar changes in glucose and heart rate.\nThe study also found that exposure to light during sleep decreased levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate sleep and has been shown to protect against heart disease.\nA previous study by the same UCSD researchers found that light during sleep also reduced production of the adiponectin horm"
