Here are some tips to make the most out of your time.\nKeep a list of things you need to do and prioritize tasks based on their level of urgency and importance. Allocate specific times for tasks that require focus, such as working on an important project or paper. Make sure to schedule breaks, too, since taking regular breaks can help you stay productive in the long run.\n2. Set goals and track your progress.\nSetting goals can help you stay motivated and focused. Break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks so you can see your progress along the way. Use a planner or calendar to track your progress and set reminders for yourself.\n3. Multitasking doesn’t always work.\nMultitasking can be counterproductive, especially when you’re juggling several tasks of varying levels of importance. Instead, focus on completing one task before moving on to the next.\n4. Take advantage of technology.\nApps and software can help you manage your time more efficiently. Use calendars and to-do lists to keep track of upcoming deadlines and scheduled events. Set reminders for yourself so you don’t forget important tasks or appointments.\n5. Learn to say “no”.\nDon’t feel obligated to take on every task or responsibility that comes your way. Learning to say “no” is an important skill when it comes to time management. Be honest with yourself about what you can realistically accomplish in the given time frame.\n6. Take regular breaks.\nTaking short breaks throughout the day can help you stay productive in the long run.

Don't hesitate to involve HR.\nWhat are some examples of effective conflict resolution strategies?\nSome examples of effective conflict resolution strategies include active listening, identifying common ground, using “I” statements, brainstorming solutions, avoiding escalation, considering win-win solutions, and seeking outside help when necessary. Active listening involves fully listening to both sides of the argument without judgment, while identifying common ground allows both parties to find areas of mutual agreement. Using “I” statements allows each party to express themselves without making accusations or putting down the other person. Brainstorming solutions encourages both parties to come up with possible solutions, while avoiding escalation means not letting the situation get worse before trying to resolve it. Considering win-win solutions involves finding a solution that meets the needs of both parties, while seeking outside help when necessary means getting assistance from a neutral third party.\nHow do you fix conflict"

        "output": "What diseases do vaccines prevent, and are there any risks associated with receiving a vaccine?\nVaccines expose the immune system to a small amount of a disease so that the immune system learns how to fight it. For most people, this generates a strong immune response that will protect them from getting the actual disease in the future. Vaccines can have minor and temporary side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or fever, but they are much safer than the diseases they prevent. Serious side effects are rare. People who are already immune to a disease or who have weakened immune systems should avoid being vaccinated.\nVaccines expose your immune system to a small amount of a disease so that your immune system learns how to fight it. This usually generates a strong immune response that will protect you from getting the actual disease in the future. Vaccines can have minor and temporary side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or fever, but they are much safer than the diseases they prevent. Serious side effects are rare. It’s important to get all recommended vaccines to stay healthy and to protect those around you.\nGetting vaccinated prevents you from getting the actual disease in the future. For example, if you got the measles vaccine as a kid, you won’t get measles. That means you also won’t be able to spread the measles virus to other people, since you won’t be contagious. This is known as herd immunity, and it helps protect entire communities—especially babies who can’t get vaccinated yet and people with weakened immune systems—from infectious diseases like measles.\nWhen a large portion of the population has been vaccinated against a particular disease, it"

AI is now a major force for change across all parts of society, from healthcare, education and manufacturing through to government policy-making. The UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has even set up an AI Council chaired by the Business Secretary Kier Starmer to drive its development.\nBut there is another issue that faces us: the ethics of AI. Who decides how it is used? In whose interests is it used? And how do we ensure the technology is developed in a way that benefits all of society?\nThese questions are at the heart of the new film, Humans Like Us which will be shown at the Cambridge Film Festival on Sunday 3 November. It focuses on an imagined world in which Alan Turing has not cracked the Enigma code and the Allies lose the Battle of the Atlantic. Set in the near future, it depicts a dystopian society where AI is controlled by a powerful corporation with links to the current US administration. One man, Sam Wilson (played by Rory Kinnear), leads a revolution to free the country from this new tyranny.\nWhile this is a work of fiction, we can see the issues depicted playing out across the world today. China, for instance, has embraced AI as a means of driving progress, with the government exhorting companies and universities to undertake research. It sees AI as a route to becoming a dominant economic and military power. It has also led to concerns about the human rights implications of using AI to make decisions – ranging from who gets access to medical treatment to who gets sent to detention centres.\nHumans Like Us was written"
