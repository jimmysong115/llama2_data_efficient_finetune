Along the way, he makes questionable allies, faces powerful enemies, and struggles to remain true to his own code. The show stars Henry Cavill as Geralt and any fans of the book series or video games will be pleased with how well this adaptation has been handled."

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",
