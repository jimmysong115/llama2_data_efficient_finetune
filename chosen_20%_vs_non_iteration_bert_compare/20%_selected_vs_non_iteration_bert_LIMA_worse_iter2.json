        "output": "The NeurIPS conference series has seen a flurry of exciting new developments in deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP) over the past few years. One line of research that has been particularly successful is the use of transformer models, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, from language modeling to summarization to machine translation.\nDespite their success, transformer models have some limitations when it comes to processing and generating long texts. In particular, they tend to suffer from the so-called \"long-range dependence\" problem, where the contextual information at one time step has a strong influence on the predictions at other time steps. This can lead to incoherent text generation and poor performance on coherence metrics.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new model architecture called ExeMA that addresses these limitations. The main idea is to replace some of the attention heads with an exponential moving average, where the decay rate is learned for each head. We show that this architecture not only improves the coherence of generated text but also leads to significant improvements on a benchmark for long-range dependency prediction."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The tech industry is facing a major problem - the lack of diversity and inclusion. While women, immigrants, and other underrepresented groups have been historically excluded from the tech industry, the impact of this inaction has become more evident than ever before. Studies have shown that having a diverse and inclusive workforce leads to increased innovation, creativity, and profitability for businesses. As a tech bro myself, I understand that many of us are hesitant to embrace change, but I urge you to consider the benefits of promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.\nFirstly, it's important to recognize that a lack of diversity and inclusion can have a negative impact on businesses. Research shows that companies with diverse teams tend to perform better financially. This is because different perspectives, experiences, and ideas lead to better decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, when employees feel valued and included, they are more likely to stay with the company, reducing turnover costs and improving overall productivity.\nSecondly, promoting diversity and inclusion can benefit all tech workers. In a male-dominated industry like ours, it's easy to assume that women don't belong or that immigrants aren't as qualified as their American counterparts. However, studies have shown that female engineers can bring unique perspectives and skills that can help solve complex problems. Likewise, immigrants often bring valuable knowledge and experience that can contribute to the growth and success of a company. By promoting diversity and inclusion, we can create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued.\nLastly, promoting diversity and inclusion is simply the right thing to do. As a tech bro, it's important to recognize that the tech industry has historically perpetuated discrimination and marginalization."

        "output": "Why did Apollo 13 fail?\n\"Apollo 13 was doomed from the start\" is a famous quote by Ron Howard, the director of the movie about the same name. Though maybe not quite so doomed as he implies, there were multiple things that could have led to disaster if they had not worked out, and luck played a part in getting the astronauts safely back to Earth.\nThe main issue with the mission was an oxygen tank explosion on April 13, 1970, while traveling to the Moon. The explosion was caused by an electrical short in one of the tanks which ignited the fuel inside. Luckily, the crew was not in the module at the time, and no one was seriously injured. However, the spacecraft was severely damaged.\nWithout enough power to run the service module's life support systems, the astronauts would surely die on the way back. So, they did what they could to jury-rig a way to use the lunar module's limited resources to get them back home. This required taking some risks, and using up consumables that were not meant for reuse. But, luckily, it all worked out, and the crew returned safely.\nOne interesting side note is that the crew ended up spending more time in space than they originally planned. They were meant to spend 5 or 6 days in space, but ended up spending 14 days. This was because they had to wait for a free window in which to return to Earth, and also because they used more energy than planned to make it back."

        "output": "Why are some of my fiddle fig leaves turning yellow?\nWhat is causing my fiddle leaf fig tree to turn yellow?\nFig trees require a minimum temperature of 60 F. (15 C.) for proper growth, but they can tolerate short periods down to 50 F. (10 C.). The best temperature range for growing figs is 65-80 F. (18-27 C.), with the most productive crop development occurring at around 75 F. (24 C.). Plants that are exposed to temperatures lower than 50 F. (10 C.) may lose their leaves in response to stress, and those below 45 F. (7 C.) usually will die. In addition, young plants or those that are stressed due to other reasons may be damaged by temperatures above 90 F. (32 C.).\nTemperature: Figs thrive in warm climates, so if your garden is located in an area that experiences cold winters, you might consider growing them in pots so that you can bring them indoors during the winter months. Alternatively, you can grow them in a greenhouse. If you do decide to overwinter your plants in a garage or basement, make sure they're not near any drafty windows or doors because cold air can still damage your plants.\nWater: When figs get too much water, they can rot. However, too little water can also cause problems. Make sure to water your plants deeply when the soil becomes dry. You should see water come out of the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot.\nFertilizer: Feed your figs every two weeks with a balanced fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 20-20-20.

One study examines why men and women make different salaries, while the other looks at the overall pay gap between men and women.\nThe first study was conducted by researchers at Harvard Business School and UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. The study found that when men and women have similar job titles and experience levels, men still tend to make more money than women. The study looked at data from over 150,000 employees working in the tech industry. It found that even after controlling for factors like education, work experience, and job title, men still made about 2% more than women on average.\nThe second study was conducted by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR). The study found that in 2019, women working full-time in the United States earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. This gap has narrowed since 1963, when women earned only 57 cents for every dollar earned by men. However, the gap has remained steady since 2009, when women began to recover financially from the Great Recession.\nOverall, these studies show that there is still a significant wage gap between men and women in the United States. While the gap is narrowing, it is important to continue to address this issue so that men and women can be paid fairly for their hard work."

But the big question is which are the good performance venues for Indian artists in the US?\nPerformance venues have different criteria for selecting artists as well as time available on their calendar. There are also a lot of factors that go into the decision making process such as size of audience, ticket price points and reputation of the venue. Obviously, getting selected to perform at Carnegie Hall will be difficult even for top performers but getting selected to perform at a local community center might be easier.\nHere are some considerations when selecting performance venues:\nSize of audience - depending on what type of music you play, the size of audience may vary. If you play Indian Classical music, it will appeal primarily to South Asian audience so you would want to pick up venues where there is a high concentration of South Asians. However, if your music is more eclectic or experimental, then you could potentially attract audience from different demographics and genres.\nTicket prices - this is an important factor as it determines how much money the venue makes on the show. Keep in mind that you need to make money too to cover your costs for travel, lodging etc. so you need to come up with a fee structure that works for both you and the venue.\nReputation of the venue - You should try to pick places that are known for showcasing quality performances. This will help your audience to identify your work as well as potential agents/managers, who might be looking for new talent.\nLocation - For traveling musicians, location is very important. Depending on where you live, it might be easier to drive than fly so keep that in mind when you book shows.\nAs an Indian performing artist, it is important to build up a relationship with presenters and venue managers.

The main components of a spam filter include:\n1. Mail Server Filtering: This is the first line of defense against spam emails, which is implemented by the mail server before the emails reach the user's inbox. Mail server filtering uses various techniques such as blacklisting, whitelisting, and content-based filtering to identify and block spam emails.\n2. User Education: Educating users on how to identify and report spam emails is crucial in preventing spam from reaching their inboxes. Users should be taught how to recognize suspicious emails, such as those with poor grammar, misspelled words, and suspicious URLs.\n3. Bayesian Filtering: This technique analyzes the language used in emails and assigns a probability score to each email based on how likely it is to be spam. The higher the probability score, the more likely the email is spam.\n4. Content-Based Filtering: This technique examines the content of emails, such as links, attachments, and images, to determine whether they are harmful or not.

        "input": "",
        "output": "8 January 2021.\nVaccinations can provide protection against a wide range of infectious diseases by triggering an immune response in the body that produces antibodies to fight off the specific virus or bacteria being targeted by the vaccine. These antibodies can recognize and neutralize the virus or bacteria if the individual is exposed to it in the future, preventing the development of the disease.\nHerd immunity refers to the protection of a community from an infectious disease when a high percentage of individuals are immune to the disease, either through vaccination or natural infection. This protects individuals who are not immune because they cannot be vaccinated or have not developed immunity due to previous infection. When there are few unprotected individuals in a community, the risk of transmission is low, and the disease cannot spread easily. This helps to protect those who are most vulnerable to the disease, such as young children or individuals with weakened immune systems.\nTo achieve herd immunity, it is important for a high percentage of the population to be vaccinated, typically around 95%. This reduces the chance of the disease spreading and prevents outbreaks, which can be particularly important in situations where the disease is dangerous or highly contagious.\nIn summary, vaccinations work by triggering an immune response in the body to protect individuals from infectious diseases, while herd immunity occurs when a high percentage of the population is immune to a particular disease, reducing the risk of transmission and preventing outbreaks."

Similarly, food advertising and marketing can also influence people's food choices, with companies often targeting vulnerable populations such as children.\nHowever, understanding how these factors influence food choices can be used to promote healthier diets. For example, public health campaigns can emphasize the health benefits of certain foods and provide nutritional information to help people make informed choices. Additionally, community-based initiatives can encourage the consumption of fresh, locally-grown produce by supporting farmers' markets or community gardens.

For instance, if a high percentage of reviews are coming from people who live in the area, it's more likely that the restaurant is popular among locals. On the other hand, if most of the reviews are coming from people who don't live nearby, it's more likely that the restaurant is popular among tourists. This information can be useful for several reasons. First, it can help travelers determine whether a restaurant is worth visiting based on its popularity among locals or tourists. Second, it can help restaurants understand their target audience and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. Finally, it can help regulators and health authorities monitor the safety and cleanliness of restaurants and take appropriate action if necessary."

        "input": "",
        "output": " Common to both the thrill-seekers and those who avoid them is that they are experiencing what psychologists call \"arousal.\" Arousal is defined as a change in one's physiological state, such as increased heart rate or sweating.\nThe brain responds to arousal by releasing chemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine, which make us feel good. These chemicals are associated with reward-seeking behavior, so people who enjoy being scared may be more likely to seek out experiences that cause them to feel this way. On the other hand, those who avoid being scared may be more sensitive to the negative aspects of arousal, such as feeling anxious or stressed.\nSo why do some people seek out arousal while others avoid it? It could be that it's all about your personality. Some people may be more risk-seeking or thrill-seeking than others, or they may simply have different ways of coping with stress. Overall, though, it seems that the desire to experience arousal is a basic human instinct that we all share in some form or another."

They may have developed trade relationships with other civilizations, and perhaps even colonized other countries.\nAnother possibility is that the Native Americans may have faced fierce competition from other groups, such as the Europeans, who were also looking to explore and settle in the New World. In this scenario, the Native Americans may have been conquered and subjugated by the Europeans, who may have tried to erase their culture and way of life.\nIt is also possible that the Native Americans could have avoided both of these outcomes by remaining isolated from other civilizations, living in peace and harmony with nature. This would have allowed them to preserve their culture and way of life, but it would have also limited their ability to interact with other societies and advance technologically.\nIn summary, the consequences of a Native American civilization being the first to cross the Atlantic would have depended on a number of factors, but there are several possible outcomes that could have occurred."

        "output": "\nThe Mongol conquests during the 13th century were some of the largest in history, and they had a profound impact on the course of world history. The Mongol Empire stretched from China to Europe, and their early successes were due to a combination of superior tactics and organization, as well as the use of cavalry charges. This allowed the Mongols to quickly conquer large swaths of land and defeat numerous armies.\n\nIf the Mongol conquests had not happened, the course of world history could have been drastically different. For one, the rise of the Ming Dynasty in China would likely have been delayed, as the Mongols had already invaded China twice before being repelled. This could have resulted in a different political structure in China, possibly even a continuation of the Yuan Dynasty.\n\nIn addition, the Mongol conquests paved the way for other empires to rise and fall throughout Asia. The Ilkhanate, which ruled parts of Iran and Anatolia, was directly founded by the Mongols. The Ottoman Empire, which later came to power in the same regions, owed much of its early success to the precedent set by the Mongols.\n\nFinally, the Mongol conquests helped to facilitate the spread of trade and cultural exchange throughout Eurasia. This led to the development of new technologies and ideas, as well as the consolidation of existing ones. Without the Mongol conquests, it is possible that these exchanges may never have occurred, leading to a less integrated and more isolated world."

The fact that half of your applicants are men and half are women has no bearing on whether or not they're qualified for the positions.\nThis isn't about numbers, it's about competence.\nAs an added note, simply hiring women because they are women will do more damage than good in the long run.

If he does, great, but if not, you have to fight your battles one at a time. In the end, it's his call.\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting a more even gender balance on your team. But trying to achieve that by hiring only women is a bad idea. You should hire the most qualified person for the job. And, as others have pointed out, there's no guarantee that any of the women you hire will actually make the team more balanced.\nAs an aside, are there any women working at the company already?

        "input": "",
        "output": "How do noise cancelling headphones/earphones work?\nNoise Cancelling Headphones - Why Do They Work?\nThe short answer is that active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones work by using a microphone to detect and measure external sounds, then producing an opposite sound wave in the same frequency range as the external sound through a built-in speaker. The two waves cancel each other out, resulting in a significant reduction of external sound.\nThere are two main types of ANC technology: passive and active. Passive noise cancelling headphones use materials such as foam or leather to block or absorb sound, while active noise cancelling headphones use a microphone and amplifier to generate an opposite sound wave.\nThe microphone in active noise cancelling headphones picks up external sounds and sends a signal to the amplifier, which produces an opposite sound wave in the same frequency range as the external sound. This sound wave is then sent through a small speaker inside the headphone, which cancels out the external sound.\nThe effectiveness of active noise cancelling headphones depends on several factors, including the quality of the microphone and amplifier, the type of headphone, and the level of ambient noise. Some headphones have adjustable settings to further customize the level of noise cancellation.\nOverall, active noise cancelling headphones are a great solution for reducing noise in noisy environments, making them popular among gamers, musicians, and anyone who needs to concentrate in a loud environment."

However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before we can actually do this.\n\nFirst of all, finding an asteroid that is suitable for this mission would be difficult. The asteroid needs to have a sufficiently stable orbit that it will not collide with any planet or moon in its path. It also needs to be large enough to support the weight of the rover and any scientific equipment that will be sent along with it.\n\nSecond, the rover itself needs to be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeorite impacts. The rover also needs to be able to operate autonomously for long periods of time without any communication with Earth.\n\nThird, we need to figure out how to get the rover to the asteroid. This could be done using a variety of methods, such as launching it from Earth or capturing it from a nearby asteroid.\n\nFinally, once the rover is on the asteroid, we need to ensure that it can communicate with Earth and transmit data back to scientists on our planet. This requires advanced communication systems and powerful antennas.\n\nOverall, sending a space rover on an asteroid and using its orbit to enter other galaxies is possible, but it's a complex and challenging task that requires a lot of research and development."

In this video, we will take a look at what police officers do to stay sane and how they cope with the trauma of investigating murders.\nIf you’ve ever wondered how homicide detectives stay sane after seeing such disturbing crime scenes, then read on. It’s not easy being a homicide detective. They must investigate the most painful and violent crimes imaginable, including rape, torture and murder. These cops work long hours and often have to deal with people who are suffering from mental illness or addiction. Their jobs can be emotionally draining, but there are ways to cope with the trauma of their job. Here are some tips for staying sane as a homicide detective.\nThe first thing that homicide detectives do is to keep their emotions in check. This means that they don’t let themselves get too attached to the victims or suspects. Instead, they try to remain objective and focused on the case. They also avoid getting caught up in the media attention surrounding the investigation. This allows them to remain professional and objective. Another way that homicide detectives stay sane is by staying physically fit. They exercise regularly and eat healthy meals. This helps them maintain their energy levels and prevent burnout.\nHomicide detectives also use humor to cope with the stress of their job. They make jokes about the cases they investigate and share stories with each other. This helps them release tension and relax after a long day of work.\nLastly, homicide detectives seek support from their colleagues.

In some cultures, it is socially acceptable to talk openly about suicide and seek help.  In other cultures, it is considered a great shame and families may hide or cover up the fact that someone has attempted or completed suicide.  In many countries, like the United States, there is a stigma associated with mental health issues and people are often reluctant to seek help for fear of being judged.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Humans often say that a dog's sense of smell is hundreds of times more powerful than a human's. The reason for this is that dogs have more scent receptors in their noses compared to humans. A dog's nose can detect scents that are up to 100,000 times lower in concentration than a human's. This means that a dog can detect odors that are too faint for a human to smell.\nDogs use their powerful sense of smell to communicate with each other and to find food, mates, and even drugs. When a dog sniffs another dog's butt, it is picking up on scents that the other dog has left behind. These scents can reveal information about the other dog's health, age, gender, and social status. Dogs also release pheromones through their anal glands that other dogs can smell, which can communicate information about the dog's mood and dominance status."

        "input": "",
        "output": "It is true that the introduction of social welfare programs has coincided with a rise in single motherhood and illegitimacy. However, research suggests that the correlation between these two phenomena and social welfare programs is weak at best. In fact, some studies have found that social welfare programs may actually reduce the rates of both single motherhood and illegitimacy.\nOne study found that states with higher levels of government support for families were associated with lower rates of both teenage pregnancy and unwed childbearing. Another study found that increases in welfare benefits for single mothers were associated with decreases in their likelihood of subsequent teenage childbearing.\nMoreover, research has shown that the negative effects of poverty on children outweigh any potential negative effects of social welfare programs on family formation. Poverty itself is a major risk factor for both single motherhood and illegitimacy. Therefore, policies aimed at reducing poverty could have a more significant impact on family stability than policies focused solely on changing incentives to marry or have children.\nOverall, the evidence suggests that social welfare programs do not have a strong causal effect on either single motherhood or illegitimacy. Rather, poverty and other factors such as lack of access to education and healthcare are more important drivers of these outcomes."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The short answer is \"Yes, it will help.\"\nHowever, there are a few details to work out.\nNot all metals are sacrificial; for example, aluminum is not sacrificial. The anode must be more electrochemically reactive than the metal it is protecting. In the case of galvanic corrosion due to salt, the sacrificial anode material needs to be more noble than steel.\nIron and steel are the most common metals in automobiles. Salt water also contains chloride ions (Cl-), which are extremely aggressive and accelerate the corrosion process.\nOne strategy for corrosion protection is to use a galvanic isolator, also called a \"sacrificial anode\" or \"impressed current system\". In this configuration, a more noble metal such as aluminum (E° = 1.65 V) is connected to the steel component to be protected, and a less noble metal such as magnesium (E° = 2.38 V) is connected to the cathode (return) terminal. Because magnesium is more positive than steel, it will be the first metal to corrode, forming a protective layer of magnesium chloride on both magnesium and steel. This process continues until all of the aluminum has been consumed, at which point the cycle repeats with the magnesium being consumed and steel being protected.\nA problem with this type of configuration is that the amount of current needed to drive the reaction can be quite high, leading to the potential for underwater arcing if the connection is made incorrectly.\nAnother approach is to use stainless steel as the anode, since it has a higher corrosion potential than carbon steel. However, since stainless steel is used for looks, rather than protection, it"

        "input": "",
        "output": "The appendix is a vestigial organ, i.e. something that is like a leftover from evolutionary history and doesn't have any current function.\nHowever, there are some researchers who believe that the appendix may have a function in maintaining gut bacteria, which play an important role in human health.\nOur guts contain trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiome. These microorganisms help break down food, produce vitamins, and regulate our immune system.\nOne hypothesis is that the appendix serves as a \"safe house\" for gut bacteria, storing them when the rest of the gut is cleansed during a disease or other event that causes diarrhea. This would allow the gut bacteria to recolonize the gut when the person recovers, rather than having to start from scratch.\nThere is evidence that this may be true. For example, children who have their appendix removed are at increased risk of developing a condition called Clostridium difficile colitis, which is a form of severe diarrhea caused by a different type of bacteria.\nIn addition, some studies have found that people with inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease) have fewer types of bacteria in their gut microbiome compared to healthy individuals. Removing the appendix has also been found to reduce the number of types of bacteria in the microbiome, suggesting that it plays a role in maintaining our gut flora.\nHowever, these studies are correlational, so they can't prove cause and effect. More work needs to be done to determine if the appendix really does have a role in maintaining gut bacteria, and if so how important that role might be."
