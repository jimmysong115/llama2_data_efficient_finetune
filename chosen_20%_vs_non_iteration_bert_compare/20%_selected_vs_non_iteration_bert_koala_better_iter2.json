In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

Instaknow-ACE implements the SOA and BPM capabilities in a radically advanced manner, using \"Non-intrusive Model Driven Architecture (n-MDA)\". Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems. An operation that can respond quickly to changing business requirements, automate and empower decision-making, create real time collaboration across the enterprise and the Web, while leveraging existing systems, can now be achieved with minimal resources and investment.\nWhat can be inner working model of this company?",

The composite solution may include existing systems such as ERP, Legacy apps, Purchase Order System, Web Store front, Inventory Management etc. Once the composite solution is built using Instaknow-ACE, then the model becomes the live operational solution with dynamic interaction between all applications. A business user initiates the procurement activity in one application (e.g. purchase order), the processes kick off other applications (e.g. ERP) for processing the orders, generates alerts/notifications in the Web store front, and updates the inventory levels in legacy systems. All these interactions are done without changing any code or XML schemas in the underlying applications."

An instance segmentation is a task that requires dividing an image into multiple instances, such as objects or people.\n2. It is a challenging task for computer vision algorithms to accurately detect and segment instances from an image.\n3. Human knowledge can improve instance segmentation performance by providing additional information about the expected instances in an image, such as their shape, size, and location.\n4. For example, a person segmentation algorithm can be trained to recognize a specific person based on their facial features and clothing, which human knowledge can provide.\n5. Additionally, human knowledge can help identify patterns and structures in an image that may not be apparent to a machine learning algorithm, such as the layout of a table or the position of objects on a shelf.\nOverall, incorporating human knowledge into instance segmentation can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm, leading to better AP metrics."

A Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is a numerical representation of the pitch and intensity of a voice signal. If we have two different signals with same loudness, then the one with higher frequency will have higher MFCC values. The mel-scale is chosen such that it approximately matches the perceptual sensitivity of the human ear for sound frequencies between 0 and 4 kHz. In audio processing, the mel scale is an equal-interval scale used to represent sounds.The mel scale is defined by an octave ratio of 1.015948987094767 or approximately 1.02.It is based on the equal-tempered scale except that its fifth is divided into seven equal parts instead of six.It allows exactly 1000 equally spaced points per octave from 0 to 2000 Hz. MFCC stands for Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, which are numerical representations of the pitch and intensity of a voice signal.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters?",

The profits made in each quarter are:\n- First quarter: $900\n- Second quarter: $920\n- Third quarter: $810\n- Fourth quarter: $880\nTo calculate the total profit percent, we need to divide the total profits by the total profits made over the period of time. Therefore, the total profit percent would be:\n$900 + $920 + $810 + $880 / $1000 = 90%\nTherefore, the total profit percent over a period of time is 90%."

Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n",
        "input": "",
        "output": "A: Yes, a double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window. For example, if the U-factor of a single pane window is 1.0 and the U-factor of a triple pane window is 0.7, then the double pane window would have a lower U-factor of 0.5 (assuming the same thickness for all three panes).\nHowever, it is important to note that the U-factor is not the only factor that determines the energy efficiency of a window. Other factors such as solar heat gain coefficient (SGC) and air leakage should also be considered. A window with a lower U-factor but higher SGF and air leakage may not be as efficient as a window with a higher U-factor but lower SGF and air leakage.\nAdditionally, the type of glass used in the window can also affect its energy efficiency. Low-emissivity (low-E) glass can help reduce heat loss in cold weather and heat gain in hot weather, thus improving the overall energy efficiency of the window.\nAs for your second question, a single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window if the U-factor of the single pane window is lower than that of the double pane window. However, this is unlikely to be the case since most windows have a U-factor of around 1.0 or higher."

For example, the vast majority of humans believe in some sort of god or gods. As an atheist, I have never seen any objective evidence that suggests the existence of a god or gods. However, I do not think it is irrational to believe in something for which there is no evidence. The issue with belief in God is that the consequences of such a belief can be very dangerous. For example, if you believe that God will take care of you then you might not save enough money for retirement. If you believe that a woman who was raped deserved it because she was dressed provocatively then you might vote against legislation designed to protect women from being assaulted.\nWhen it comes to politics, I suspect that most people vote for the candidate they believe is the lesser of two evils. For example, many people voted for Trump because they believed Clinton was the greater evil. There is zero evidence that Trump will do a better job as president than Clinton would have.\nTo me, the reason why people vote for the lesser of two evils is because they are afraid of the other candidate. For example, if you believe that the Democrats are more evil than the Republicans then you are more likely to vote for the Republican candidate even if you know that they both support policies that hurt the poor and middle class.\nI do not think that it is rational to believe in God(s) or in any religion.

It is a great one, and I am happy to share some ideas with you!\nFirst of all, can I just say how impressed I am that as a congregation, you have already begun developing creative ways of fostering more Shabbat celebration and observance at home and in synagogue? That's fantastic!  In my experience, the most important step in encouraging people to keep Shabbat is creating an open and welcoming culture that makes it clear that Shabbat is something special, and that everyone is invited to participate.  I would love to share some ideas with you about how to develop and deepen this culture.\nYou mentioned that Shabbat dinner after services is very popular with your community. This is a wonderful starting point, and I am sure many people look forward to it each week!  One way to think about expanding upon this tradition would be to invite people to speak about their personal experiences of Shabbat. For example, you could ask someone to talk about what Shabbat means to them, or how they make their Shabbat special. Another way to do this would be to have a short workshop beforehand, where people could learn together about different aspects of Shabbat observance (e.g., what are the traditional rituals?, why is Shabbat important?, etc.). This would give people the opportunity to connect with each other and also learn something new.\nAnother idea might be to introduce a monthly Shabbat meal where everyone brings a dish. This would give people the chance to contribute their own specialties to the community meal, while also highlighting the communal aspect of Shabbat. This could be combined with a service, or held independently from services.\nFinally, you mentioned that some people in"
