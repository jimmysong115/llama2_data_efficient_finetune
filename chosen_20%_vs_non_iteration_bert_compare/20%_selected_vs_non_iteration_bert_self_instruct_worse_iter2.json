It’s this plot point that will presumably drive much of the subsequent story from here on out.\nThat’s all well and good, but The Rings of Power has a serious problem with pacing. With 5 episode sandwiching one major event, it felt like an eternity before the show allowed us to see what we actually came to see.\nIn fact, the first hour of the series is almost completely devoid of any action until a brief skirmish about 10 minutes in. Then there’s another lull until the last 20 minutes. It feels like the writers were too busy with world building and character development to focus on the struggle between good and evil that makes fantasy stories so compelling.\nA lot of the characters are underdeveloped or downright annoying – especially the humans. The acting is fine but the writing often feels wooden and forced.\nIt’s also weird that so many characters sounded like they were from Ireland. I realize they were trying to go for a British or Irish feel, but it was distracting. Why not just cast actual British and Irish actors?\nStill, there are some redeeming qualities here. The visual effects and cinematography are stunning. There are some truly bre"

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.",

With its themes of self-discovery, individualism, and the importance of pursuing one’s dreams, it is no surprise that the cinematography in the movie is equally captivating and inspiring.\nThe film’s visual style is characterized by its use of warm colors, natural lighting, and sweeping shots that capture the beauty of the natural world. The lush green meadows, the towering trees, and the majestic mountains all serve as backdrops for the story of the young men who come alive under the guidance of their English teacher, Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams). The use of color is particularly effective in conveying the emotions of the characters. For example, when Neil (Ralph Macchio) is struggling with his decision to stay true to himself or give into peer pressure, the scene is bathed in blue, signifying his feeling of isolation and sadness. Similarly, when Todd (Ethan Hawke) begins to open up and embrace his love of poetry, the scene is filled with red, symbolizing his passion and vitality.\nThe cinematography also highlights the close relationships between the students and their teacher. The shots are often intimate, emphasizing the trust and mutual respect that develops between them. One particularly memorable scene is when the boys climb to the top of a hill to watch the sunrise. The camera lingers on their faces as they gaze out at the beautiful landscape, their expressions filled with awe and wonder. This moment serves as a metaphor for the transformative power of poetry and literature, which can help us see the world in new ways and find our place in it.\nOverall, the cinematography in Dead Poets Society perfectly captures the themes and emotions of"

These subproblems are solved repeatedly using a recurrence relation, which allows us to solve larger problems more efficiently than if we were to solve them directly.\nFor example, consider the problem of finding the longest string in an array of strings. We can solve this problem using DP by first finding the length of the longest string in an array of size 1, then the length of the longest string in an array of size 2, and so on.\nLet's consider a more general problem: given two arrays A[ ] and B[ ], find the maximum difference between any two elements of A[] and B[].\nThe solution is to use DP again. We can divide the problem into two cases: when the dimension of A[] is less than or equal to the dimension of B[], and when the dimension of A[] is greater than the dimension of B[].\nIn the first case, we can simply compare the two arrays element-wise and get the maximum difference. In the second case, we can use DP to solve the problem recursively. The base case is when the dimensions of A[] and B[] are both 1. In this case, we can just compare the two elements directly and get the maximum difference.\nThe recursive case works as follows: suppose we have two arrays A[ ] and B[ ] of dimensions n and m respectively. If n < m, then we can use the fact that max(A[i], B[j]) <= max(B[i], A[j]) for all i and j. This means that we can solve the problem by comparing each element of A[] with each element of B[] and getting the maximum difference. If n > m, then we can use DP to solve the problem recursively.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
