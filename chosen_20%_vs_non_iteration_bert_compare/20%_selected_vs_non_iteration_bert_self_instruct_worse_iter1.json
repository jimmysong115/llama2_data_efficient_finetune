It's like they took all the best parts out and replaced them with boring political intrigue and pointless subplots.\"\n\nI feel this way because I am a fan of Tolkien's works, and after watching the first two episodes of the series, I was hoping for an adaption that would be true to the spirit of the books. Instead, we get a very watered down version of what makes Tolkien's world so great, with characters that are barely recognizable from their source material, and a plot that feels like it's just going through the motions.\n\nBut perhaps this is the point. Maybe the showrunners realize that people like me are looking for a faithful adaption, and so they're trying to subvert our expectations by creating something that is not only different from the books, but also (in my opinion) inferior to them.\n\nIf this is the case, then I have to ask: Why? Why create a new work that is so obviously inferior to its source material? Why not just make a completely new fantasy series, one that is unencumbered by the expectations of fans like me?\n\nMaybe the answer lies in the fact that there is no such thing as a fresh idea anymore. Everything has been done before, and we know it. So when a new work comes along that tries to rehash something that's already been done, we can't help but compare it to the original. And if it falls short, we're bound to be disappointed.\nSo maybe the real question here is: How do we move beyond this cycle of derivative works, where everything is just a rehash of something else? How do we create truly new and innovative stories that capture our imagin"

Use bullet points to break up long text into more manageable chunks, and be selective about which details are most important to include.

Use any extra details as supporting material in your speaker notes or handout.\nA traditional background design often includes a solid color for the background and white lettering.

Open these two branches in your editor or IDE. Now make sure both are identical. For example, if your local branch is at line 400 and remote branch is at line 399, add one more line in your local branch and push it to the remote branch.\nThis command will create a new local branch called \"merged\" which should be identical to both \"remotes/origin/develop\" and \"your-local-branch\". In my case, my local branch was \"develop\" so command would be:\n$ git checkout -b merged remotes/origin/develop develop\nNow you can commit and push your changes to the \"merged\" local branch.\nIf your local branch is already up-to-date with the remote branch (i.e., you didn't make any changes locally), you don't have to do anything. Just type:\n$ git checkout merged\nand you are done. You can now merge your local branch into the remote branch.\nYour local branch is now ready to be merged into the remote branch.\nLet's assume you want to merge \"develop\" into \"master\". Switch to \"develop\" branch and run the following commands.\n$ git checkout master\n$ git merge develop\nIn GitHub, when you try to merge a branch, it gives you two options - edit the diff and then merge or skip the editing and merge anyway.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

        "output": "\nFair trade has its roots in the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Fair trading organizations were set up in Europe and North America to certify that products came from free laborers. The International Fair Trade Association has traced the origins of fair trade to the early Cooperative Wholesale Society founded by Roland Hill in Taplow, England in 1844.[3] In the United States and Canada, organizations such as the Student Christian Movement and the YMCA supported cooperatives in European countries as a way to promote better prices for farmers and workers. The first fair trade store was opened in Harlem, NY in 1968 by Judson Mills, who also worked with the Catholic Worker Movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, fair trade organizations became more widespread, particularly in Europe. In the early 21st century, fair trade became more international in scope, with organizations in Japan, Korea, and other parts of Asia.\nThe concept of fair trade is based upon the idea of mutually beneficial long-term relationships between producers and consumers, not simply short-term transactions. Additionally, fair trade organizations seek to address the power imbalance between producers and buyers. The goals of fair trade organizations are to: raise the standard of living of producers; eliminate or reduce the exploitation of producers; assist producers in gaining access to markets; ensure that producers receive the revenues necessary to invest in their future; and protect the environment and promote sustainability. Organizations also strive to empower producers through education and training.\nThere are many organizations dedicated to promoting fair trade. One example is TransFair USA, a nonprofit organization that provides for the certification and promotion of fair trade products. Another example is the Fairtra"

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",
        "output": "\nThe researchers also found that when the young adults spent a second night in the lab with the lights dimmed, their bodies adjusted somewhat to the lower light level. The changes in blood sugar and heart rate were reduced compared with the first night. But both remained higher than they were when the participants slept in a well-lit room.\n“We know that sleep is so important for health,” Zee said. “This study shows that one aspect of sleep — the light environment — is not benign.”\nAni Manjikiani, an assistant professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, called it “very interesting.”\n“There are other studies that have looked at sleep and glucose metabolism, but this is the first time I’ve seen them looking at sleep and heart rate variability,” Manjikiani said.\nHeart rate variability refers to the variations in the time between each heartbeat. A person’s overall heart rate variability is influenced by factors such as age, physical fitness and emotional state. Higher overall heart rate variability has been associated with better outcomes, including survival after a heart attack and improved cardiovascular health after reperfusion of the heart following a heart attack. Lower heart rate variability has been linked to increased risk of death and heart disease.\n“It makes sense physiologically that if you have less variability, your body is not very good at recovering from stressors,” Manjikiani said.\nZee said she thinks the results could extend to all types of light — not just the light produced by TV sets and computer screens. And the findings likely apply equally to children and older adults, she said.\n“Light at night can disrupt circadian rhythms, which are important across the life"
