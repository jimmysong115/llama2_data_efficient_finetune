        "input": "",
        "output": "There are different types of transitions and signposts that you can use in academic writing to connect your ideas and guide your reader. Some examples are:\n1. Advancing the argument: This type of transition shows the relationship between two ideas and how they support each other. For example, “furthermore,” “in addition,” “moreover.”\n2. Causal relation: This type of transition shows how one idea causes another. For example, “since,” “because,” “as a result.”\n3. Summary: This type of transition summarizes the main points of the previous paragraph or section. For example, “in summary,” “to conclude,” “in brief.”\n4. Shift in direction: This type of transition shows a change in the direction of the argument. For example, “however,” “on the other hand,” “but.”\n5. Temporal relation: This type of transition shows the relationship between two events in time. For example, “first,” “second,” “finally.”\nHere is an example of a paragraph that uses effective transitions and signposts:\nThe main cause of global warming is the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm up the Earth’s surface. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. It is produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The more fossil fuels we burn, the more carbon dioxide we emit. However, there are other factors that contribute to global warming, such as deforestation and urbanization. In summary, while the greenhouse effect is the main cause of global warming, there are other factors that contribute to it."
