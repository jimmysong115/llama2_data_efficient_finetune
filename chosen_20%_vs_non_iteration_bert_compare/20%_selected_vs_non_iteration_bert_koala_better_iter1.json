Clicking on the title of the movie will take you to its listing at the Archive.\nNote that this is just a list of links, not a list of actual movies.\nCopyright law changed significantly between 1923 and 1978, so many movies that were once presumed to be in the public domain have turned out to be still protected. Some of the movies listed above may have had their copyright renewed. Check for each specific movie to determine its current status.\nIt would be helpful if you provided more specific criteria for what you're looking for. What types of movies? Genres? Specific time period? Budget? Type of work (i.e. feature vs. serial vs. short)?\nI don't know how long it will take you to sift through all these, but you could start with a few of the ones that interest you most and do a little research on your own. For example, for each one, check the imdb page and look for reviews and user comments that mention things like \"public domain\" or \"available for free\". Or try searching for the actual title on archive.org without quotes (e.g. \"the general\") to find fan-made dvds that have been released."

In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created to provide electricity to areas of Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The TVA built dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries to create hydroelectric power. These dams not only provided electricity but also helped control flooding and provide recreational opportunities such as fishing and boating.\nToday, there are over 80,000 dams in the United States that provide power, irrigation, flood control, and recreation. However, dams also pose risks. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the levees and drainage systems of New Orleans, Louisiana. This led to widespread flooding and the deaths of over 1,800 people. Water safety engineering projects aim to prevent or minimize these types of disasters by taking into account the risks associated with water and using engineering solutions to mitigate those risks.\nOne example of a water safety engineering project is the creation of a dam break emergency plan. A dam break occurs when the failure of a dam releases a large amount of water suddenly. This can cause severe flooding downstream. To prepare for this type of emergency, a dam break emergency plan should be created that includes evacuation routes, emergency contact information, and instructions for turning off utilities. The plan should also include a communication system to alert people downstream of the potential danger.\nAnother example of a water safety engineering project is the construction of levees around cities to protect against flooding. Levees are walls or embankments that are built around low-lying areas to"

        "output": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge.\nInstance segmentation is a difficult task for AI models and can be improved by leveraging human knowledge. Here are some ways to leverage human knowledge to improve instance segmentation AP metrics:\n1) Use human annotated bounding boxes: Provide humans with the images with their ground truth segmentation masks and ask them to provide the bounding boxes for each object in the image. These boxes can then be used to train an instance segmentation model.\n2) Use bounding box predictions from a person in the loop: Ask a human to provide the bounding boxes for objects in the image and use these boxes as initial guesses for the instance segmentation model. The model's predictions can then be refined using these initial guesses.\n3) Use labels from a human in the loop: Ask a human to provide the segmentation masks for objects in the image and use these masks to train an instance segmentation model.\n4) Use domain specific knowledge: If you have expert knowledge about the domain of the images, such as knowing which objects are likely to appear in the images, you can use this knowledge to improve instance segmentation performance. For example, if you know that certain types of cars are likely to appear in the images, you can train a model to recognize those car models.\n5) Use transfer learning: Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a related task, such as object detection, and fine-tuning it for instance segmentation. This can help improve instance segmentation performance."

        "output": "Being off-grid, in a sense, means to be disconnected from the utility grids and only rely on renewable energy sources like solar, wind or hydro power. In contrast, self-sufficient living spaces mean that you are able to provide for your basic needs – food, water, shelter and energy – without having to depend on outside resources.\nHere’s what you need to know about creating a self-sufficient living space:\n1. Solar power is one of the most reliable renewable energy sources you can use to power your home. Solar energy is created from the sun’s radiation, which produces electricity that can be used to power homes. The key components of a solar power system include solar panels, batteries, and an inverter. Solar panels collect the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity, while batteries store the energy for later use. An inverter converts the direct current (DC) electricity produced by the solar panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in your home.\n2. Wind power is another reliable renewable energy source that can be used to power your home. Wind turbines are installed on your property to generate electricity. Wind turbines work by using the wind’s kinetic energy to spin a generator, which produces electricity. The key components of a wind power system include wind turbines, batteries, and an inverter.\n3. Hydro power is a renewable energy source that can be generated from moving water, such as rivers or streams. A hydro power system includes a turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. The key components of a hydro power system include a dam, turbine, and generator.\n4.

This can lead to an inconsistent understanding of the world, as individuals may refuse to accept new information or interpret it in a way that aligns with their existing beliefs.\nInconsistency, on the other hand, refers to a lack of consistency or coherence in one's thoughts, beliefs, or actions. This can be a result of many factors, including emotions, social pressure, or a lack of critical thinking skills.\nWhen individuals engage in ideological thinking, they may become increasingly inconsistent in their thinking and behavior. This is because their beliefs are not grounded in reality and may change based on new information or experiences that conflict with their original beliefs. For example, an individual who holds strongly to a political ideology may become more vocal and defensive when challenged on their beliefs, even if the challenges are based on sound logic and evidence.\nOverall, ideological thinking can lead to inconsistency in thinking and behavior, as individuals may become attached to their beliefs and resistant to new information or perspectives that challenge those beliefs."

For example, if you bet your own money on a coin toss, you are said to have skin in the game. If you bet someone else’s money, you don’t have skin in the game, but rather are saying to yourself, “I’m taking risks with this other guy’s money, so I better be careful.”\nWhy should this matter? Because, according to Taleb, randomness is part of life. There is no way to predict the future. So if you’re relying on predictions about the future to make investment decisions, you will often be wrong.\nThose without skin in the game tend to ignore randomness and the mistakes they made because they didn’t lose their own money. They just repeat the same mistakes over and over again, hanging onto the illusion that they are clever.\nIn contrast, those who have skin in the game face reality. They learn from their mistakes, adapt, and become successful.\nRead More: What is the Kelly Criterion?\nTaleb was an options trader before becoming a professor at New York University.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",

        "instruction": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

If you’re looking for a high quality, long lasting chain that will give your jewelry an elegant look, a 925 sterling silver Miami Cuban link chain is a great choice. However, the price tag can be tough to swallow. Here is some information about Miami Cuban link chains and how to choose one.\nChoose the right width Xinrui The width of the chain refers to the distance between each link. Most people choose a chain with a medium width because it is versatile and looks good with most types of charms and pendants. However, if you want your chain to really stand out, you can choose a narrow or wide width chain. Also consider the thickness of the links when choosing a width. Thinner links will show more detail on your charms, while thicker links may look better if you want a simple, classic look.\nAvoid cheap material You might be tempted to buy a Cuban link chain made of gold or platinum, but they are extremely expensive. Instead, buy a high quality 925 sterling silver chain. This is a very durable metal that won’t tarnish, and it is much less expensive than other precious metals. If you want a golden or rose gold look, try using a plating process instead of buying a solid gold or rose gold chain.\nConsider the length Many people choose a 20 inch (51 cm) chain, but you can get a shorter or longer chain if you prefer. A shorter chain will look best with a pendant, while a longer chain adds visual interest to a necklace with no pendant. Try on several chains at different lengths to see which one you like best."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Late hop additions provide a clean, crisp bitterness with just enough hop aroma to balance the sweetness from the malt. The idea behind dry hopping is to allow the hops to fully express their essential oils and acids, which can be easily lost during the boil.\nThe dry hop process adds an extra pop of flavor and aroma that can not be obtained from using only hop pellets or hop flowers. Dry hopping also allows for more yeast and nutrient attenuation, which results in a cleaner, more refreshing tasting beer. When are hops added to the brewing process?\nDuring the boil, hops are added to add bitterness and flavor to the wort. Hops can also be added late in the boil process, as well as just before the end of the boil, to create different hop profiles.\nAdding hops late in the boil will add more hop aroma than adding them early, but it will also increase the chances of the hops getting too hot and releasing harsh, bitter compounds. Adding hops near the beginning of the boil allows you to increase the amount of hop utilization, which will make your beer more bitter. This can be useful if you want to adjust the IBUs of your beer after it has been fermented.\nMid-boil hopping is when you add 12 to 15 minutes into the boil.\nLate hop additions are usually made within the last 10 minutes of the boil.\nThe longer the hops are left in the boil, the more alpha acids are released, which will contribute to increased bitterness. Additionally, the more hop oils that are released, the more aromatic your beer will be. This is why"

As a native Arizonan, I had the opportunity to spend several summers living and working in Flagstaff, and my experiences there have left a lasting impression on me.\nOne of the most striking features of Flagstaff is its breathtaking natural beauty. The city is surrounded by towering mountains, including the iconic San Francisco Peaks, which rise to an elevation of over 12,000 feet. These mountains provide endless opportunities for hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities. In fact, one of my favorite memories from my time in Flagstaff was hiking to the top of Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona, and watching the sunrise from the summit.\nAnother aspect of Flagstaff that stood out to me was its tight-knit community. Despite being a relatively small city, Flagstaff has a strong sense of community pride and a deep connection to its history. One example of this is the historic downtown area, which has been carefully restored and preserved over the years. Another is the local arts scene, which features a variety of galleries, museums, and performance venues showcasing the work of talented local artists.\nHowever, Flagstaff is not without its challenges. Like many cities in the American West, it faces issues related to water management and conservation. Additionally, the city's location at high elevation puts it at risk for air pollution and wildfires. These challenges are exacerbated by its proximity to nearby national forests, which provide ample opportunity for outdoor recreation but also make it easier for fires"

Some of these include chronicling important events for future generations to learn from, preserving cultural traditions and practices, and even just for personal reflection and memory. Documenting history is an important part of understanding where we've come from and how far we've progressed as a society, and it serves as a foundation for us to build upon in the future.\nIn many ways, history can be seen as a continuous cycle of progress and regress, with each era learning from the mistakes of those who came before while building on the successes. By documenting the past, we ensure that future generations are able to benefit from our knowledge and avoid repeating the same mistakes. This is especially true when it comes to political and social issues, such as discrimination, war, and inequality. By recording and studying these events, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just society.\nFurthermore, documenting history allows us to preserve cultural traditions and practices that may otherwise be lost over time. These traditions often hold great significance for the people who practice them and can help foster a sense of identity and community. By documenting them, we can ensure that they are passed down to future generations and continue to be a part of our collective heritage.\nFinally, documenting history can also serve as a source of personal reflection and memory. Many people use journals, diaries, and other forms of writing to record their experiences and emotions, which can be incredibly valuable for understanding oneself and one's place in the world. By documenting our own lives and sharing them with others, we create a sort of historical record that can be studied and learned from by future generations.\nIn conclusion, documenting history is crucial for understanding where we've come from and how far we'"

        "input": "",
        "output": "A: A double pane window may be more efficient than a triple pane window, but it depends on the climate and other factors. \nTo compare the energy efficiency of different window designs, we can use the U-factor as a measure. The U-factor is a measure of how well a material or material assembly (e.g., a window) insulates against heat flow. The lower the U-factor, the better the insulation performance.\nThe U-factor for single, double, and triple panes of glass vary depending on the climate and other factors, but here are some general guidelines:\nIn cold climates (i.e., where heating is required for most of the year), triple pane windows typically have a lower U-factor than double pane windows. This is because the additional pane of glass provides more insulation against heat loss.\nIn warm climates (i.e., where air conditioning is required for most of the year), double pane windows with a low-e coating may be more efficient than triple pane windows without a low-e coating. The additional pane of glass in the triple pane window would increase the solar heat gain coefficient (SGHC), which would result in more heat gain in the summer.\nHowever, it's important to note that other factors besides U-factor and SGHC can affect the energy efficiency of windows, such as air leakage, window frame material, and window size. Therefore, it's best to consult with an experienced professional in the field to determine the most energy-efficient windows for a specific location and climate."

Duck typing means that if an object responds to methods with expected properties, then it should be treated as an instance of that object. In this example, the `area` function expects two properties from an object: `width` and `height` for `Rectangle` and `radius` for `"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Carbon Fibres are used in the Building Construction Industry to create composites that are extremely lightweight, high strength and have very good thermal properties. Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are often used for structural members such as columns, beams and flooring and can provide a 40% weight saving over traditional steel or aluminium options. Carbon fibres are also used for insulation purposes where their high thermal resistance characteristics are beneficial.\nWhat building materials are made of recycled materials?\nRecycled materials are used in many different forms of construction including bricks, drywall, concrete, and even lumber. Recycled plastic lumber is an increasingly popular material for decking, fencing, and other outdoor applications. In addition to saving resources by reusing existing materials, these green building materials help to reduce the carbon footprint of construction.\nHow are carbon fibers made?\nCarbon fibers are made from polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which is derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. The process to make carbon fibers begins with the purification of raw materials using solvents. These materials are then placed in cylindrical vessels and put under extreme heat and pressure to produce long, thin threads of the material. Finally, these threads are treated with chemicals to enhance their electrical conductivity and make them more durable.\nWhy do buildings collapse when there is an earthquake?\nBuildings collapse mainly due to the failure of unreinforced masonry walls, weak columns and foundations, improper construction, and poor quality control during construction. During an earthquake, the shaking causes excessive forces to act on the structure, leading to failure. The failure mode can be due to overturning, flexure, shear, or a combination"

Bush administration and is now a senior editor at The Atlantic. Frum has been highly critical of Trump and says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so you’d be forgiven for thinking Obama and Frum would have little in common.\nBut they had plenty to chat about. They talked about the breakdown of political norms, the media, and the current state of both parties. Obama didn’t pull any punches on any of these topics — especially when it came to the GOP — but he also expressed understanding for the challenges conservatives face, including convincing their base to support unpopular policies.\n“David and I probably don’t agree on much politically,” Obama said. But he added that he still values having conversations with people who see things differently."

It feels like less effort to watch three of those back to back than it does to watch one 2 hour film.\nThis is probably because there are more distractions and interruptions when you watch a single 2 hour movie. You have to find the time to sit down and watch it all at once, without any outside influences interrupting your viewing. However, when you watch TV, you can watch short bursts of it whenever you want, so it doesn't really matter if you only have 15 minutes to spare - you can easily watch half an episode in that time."

        "output": "Rationality is relative to the objectives of an agent, and the ideal of rationality is to maximize expected utility. An agent can be rational even if their goals are irrational, in which case they will make decisions that other agents would consider crazy, like sacrificing their health or their children’s futures for short-term pleasures. Even when acting rationally, agents may have conflicting goals and may not believe the same things, so there is no basis for claims that one agent’s beliefs are rational while another’s are not. For instance, a utilitarian may think that torturing one person to save five is rational, while a deontologist would find it immoral.\nThe concept of rationality has different meanings in philosophy, psychology, logic, and economics. In philosophy, rationality refers to the use of reason to arrive at true conclusions. In psychology and logic, it refers to making correct choices on the basis of one’s reasons. In economics, rationality implies that the individual acts in a way that maximizes his or her utility.\nHow do you know if your beliefs are rational?\nWhen evaluating whether one’s beliefs are rational, several factors must be taken into account: One’s goals, desires, and values, as well as what one believes about the world and how one goes about achieving one’s goals. Sometimes the question is raised whether an agent is rational if she holds two contradictory beliefs, such as “God exists” and “God does not exist”. This article discusses some questions about rationality, but it is not meant as a comprehensive survey of all issues surrounding rationality.\nSuppose that two people desire to maximize utility and only act on the basis of their beliefs.
