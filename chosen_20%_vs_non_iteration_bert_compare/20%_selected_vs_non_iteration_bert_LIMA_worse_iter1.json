        "output": "The indigenous language of the Incas and one of the most widely spoken in South America is Quechua. The language has over 10 million speakers, mostly in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, but also in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Mexico. There are several dialects of Quechua, including highland, coastal, and Southern. Many famous scholars have devoted their lives to studying and preserving Quechua.\nOne of the most influential scholars of Quechua was Angel Maria Terrazas, who is credited with standardizing the language in the mid-20th century. He also wrote several textbooks, grammar books and dictionaries in both Spanish and Quechua. Another influential scholar was Lilia Zegarra, who published a dictionary of Quechua in 1987 and wrote numerous articles on the language.\nOther notable scholars include Ricardo Rojas, who translated the Bible into Quechua, and Alfredo Torero, who wrote the first novel in Quechua. In more recent years, Claribel Alegría has become an advocate for Quechua and has written several children's books in the language. Finally, Joaquín Arias has done extensive research on the history and evolution of Quechua, publishing several books on the subject."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Gender pay gap remains stubbornly persistent.\nAnother month, another report showing that the UK gender pay gap has barely shifted. The Equality and Human Rights Commission’s latest statistics reveal that women are still paid 18.1% less than men on average (down from 18.4% in 2016). This is bad news for the government, which had hoped to close the gap by 2025. It is also bad news for anyone who believes that progress is being made towards a fairer society.\nThere is plenty of speculation as to why this gap persists. Some argue that it is due to discrimination and bias in hiring and promotion practices. Others blame it on occupational segregation and different choices between men and women about work-life balance. But these factors cannot explain the entirety of the gap.\nWhen we look at the difference in hourly pay between full-time workers, there is no gender pay gap among those aged 16-29. Why? Because when young people enter the labour market they are allocated to jobs with lower earning potential, regardless of their gender. For example, they are more likely to be employed in the retail and hospitality industries, where wages are low. As a result, when we compare all workers regardless of age, the gender pay gap increases to 18.1%.\nIn fact, the gender pay gap starts to emerge in the first year of a person’s working life. By the time they are 29, those who started work as babies doing unpaid family work receive lower wages than others, so the gap widens again. This can be explained by the “gender socialisation” of new entrants into the labour market. Young women are socialised to prioritise caring over paid employment, while young men are social"

Every attempt I've seen so far has assumed that the government will allow them to somehow do this without competition from PG&E.  I don't see how that can happen.\nAt the very least, you need to get past all the regulatory barriers erected by PG&E.  If you could crack those, then you would be in business.  The most efficient way to do this is to buy out a local co-op and threaten to shut down service unless they are allowed to join your new co-op.\nHere are some of the major regulatory barriers:\n1. You can't just build a power line and connect it to the grid.  PG&E controls where the lines go and who pays for what.  It costs about $20M/mile to string a new line.  They have thousands of miles of line.  \n2. You can't just start buying power from somewhere else.  PG&E gets preferential treatment on their purchases because they control the switches as well.  They also get a penalty if they don't use all the power they generate.  This means they have an economic incentive to generate more than they need.  If you start buying from somewhere else, they can sue you for damages and they can also cut you off.  This is why Apple's \"renewable\" program with PG&E doesn't work.  Apple signed a contract with PG&E to only buy renewable power.  When the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, Apple takes power from the rest of the grid.  PG&E generates extra power at these times and charges Apple less for it.  Apple pays about half of what the rest of"

In fact, the USA spends more on healthcare as a percentage of GDP than any other country in the world.\nThe US healthcare system is also highly fragmented, with each state having its own healthcare system.

        "input": "",
        "output": "The potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health are significant.\nFirstly, single-use plastic bottles are often made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which is a type of plastic that takes hundreds of years to decompose. When these bottles end up in landfills, they release toxic chemicals such as dioxins and furans that can contaminate soil and groundwater. In addition, when plastic bottles are incinerated, they emit harmful pollutants such as dioxins and furans into the air.\nSecondly, single-use plastic bottles have a significant impact on the environment due to their production process. The manufacturing of plastic bottles requires large amounts of energy and resources, as well as the use of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine and benzene. This process also generates significant amounts of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\nOn the other hand, reusable bottles are made from materials such as stainless steel, glass, or silicone, which are non-toxic and do not contribute to environmental pollution. Reusable bottles also reduce waste by avoiding the need for single-use plastic bottles. Additionally, reusable bottles can be washed and sanitized, reducing the risk of bacterial contamination.\nFrom a human health perspective, single-use plastic bottles can leach harmful chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) into the water they contain. These chemicals have been linked to various health problems such as reproductive issues, obesity, and cancer.\nIn conclusion, the choice between single-use plastic bottles and reusable bottles has significant implications"

        "input": "",
        "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a boon for the canine population. Not only are dogs being adopted in record numbers, but they are also being used to detect COVID-19 patients with impressive accuracy. Now, researchers reporting in ACS' Analytical Chemistry have found that dogs can accurately identify infected people with as much precision as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test—the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing the disease.\nDogs have a well-documented sense of smell that is hundreds of times more acute than that of humans. Previous research has shown that dogs can sniff out everything from cancer to land mines and even predict epileptic seizures. They can even tell when their owners are about to give birth. These capabilities have raised interest in developing a \"breathalyzer\" that dogs could use to screen for diseases. In the new study, researchers wanted to see if dogs could accurately detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in exhaled breath.\nYoshihiro Sakurai and colleagues conducted a small trial involving 24 people who were either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or were healthy controls. Each person blew into a bag containing cotton swabs that had been dusted with the virus. The team gave each dog 10 swabs to sniff during a 40-minute session. The dogs correctly identified 16 of the 17 positive samples and no negative samples, for a 94% overall accuracy. When the researchers applied a PCR test to the same samples, it correctly identified all 17 positive samples and zero negative ones, again with perfect accuracy. The results support the view that dogs have exceptional odor detection abilities and suggest that a device based on this idea"

        "input": "",
        "output": "By Krista Varady, PhD, CNS and Katherine Brooking, MS\nThe way we eat has a lot to do with culture, social norms, and economic factors. Making healthy food choices is not always easy in our society where fast food restaurants are abundant and the cost of fresh fruits and vegetables can be prohibitive for many people. But there are things we can do as individuals and as a society to change our eating patterns. Here’s how cultural, social, and economic factors influence people’s food choices and how this knowledge can be used to promote healthier diets.\nOur society has a love affair with convenience and speed. We want meals at our fingertips, ready when we are. This mentality has led to the proliferation of fast food restaurants. In fact, the average American spends 13% of their day consuming food away from home (2). Fast food restaurants offer cheap, high calorie food that is convenient for busy people on the go. These restaurants use fat, sugar, and salt to make their food taste good. Because of this, these types of food have become addictive, making it difficult for some people to eat anything else.\nIn addition, the relatively low cost of fast food means that many people rely on these restaurants for their main source of food (3). The cost of produce, however, is much higher than that of processed foods. This makes it hard for some people to afford healthy food options. Further, farmers in developing countries may grow certain types of crops because they make more money, even though these crops may not be the healthiest for us.\nEven if one can afford healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, different cultures have different tastes and preferences. Many people in the US live in “food deserts,”"

        "input": "",
        "output": "How can you determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists, and why might this information be useful?\nTo determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists, you can look at factors such as the location of the restaurant, the pricing, the menu offerings, and the type of cuisine. If the restaurant is located in an area that is primarily tourist-oriented, chances are it will attract more tourists than locals. Additionally, if the prices are higher than average, it may indicate that the restaurant is aimed at a more affluent clientele, which could also suggest that it is popular with tourists. The menu offerings can also provide insight into whether the restaurant is catering to locals or tourists. For example, if the menu includes dishes that are typical of the local cuisine, it is likely that the restaurant is popular with locals. On the other hand, if the menu is dominated by dishes that are more commonly found in tourist destinations, it may indicate that the restaurant is popular with tourists. This information can be useful because it can help you make informed decisions about where to eat when traveling to a new place. For example, if you want to experience the local cuisine, you may want to avoid restaurants that are popular with tourists and instead seek out establishments that are frequented by locals."

Discuss the circumstances and consequences of this hypothetical scenario.\nIf a Native American civilization had been the first to cross the Atlantic, it is likely that their discovery of the new continent would have significant impact on the course of history. The Native Americans may have established trade routes with Europeans and Africans, leading to a more interconnected world. They may also have brought their own unique cultural practices and beliefs to the new land, which could have influenced the development of the local culture.\nHowever, there are also potential negative consequences to consider. For example, the Native Americans may have faced discrimination and oppression from European colonizers who viewed them as inferior. This could have led to the loss of their traditional ways of life and cultures. Additionally, the environmental impact of colonization could have been devastating, as the Europeans brought with them diseases and other factors that disrupted the balance of the local ecosystem.\nOverall, it is impossible to say for sure what would have happened if a Native American civilization had been the first to cross the Atlantic. It is possible that their discovery could have had a positive impact on global history, but it is also possible that it would have been overshadowed by the dominance of European powers."

They eventually reached Europe, where they were stopped at the gates of Vienna by a combined force of European armies.\nThe Mongols were one of the most feared empires in history. They were well known for their brutality, and their conquests changed the course of world history. If the Mongol conquest during the 13th Century never happened, the world would be a very different place today.\nOne of the most significant changes would be in Asia. Without the Mongol conquest, China would likely have remained independent and not been divided into warring factions. This could have led to a more unified and prosperous China.\nAdditionally, without the Mongol conquest, India may have been able to maintain its independence from foreign rule. The Mongols were decimated by the Indian forces at the Battle of Khanwa in 1527, and this victory allowed India to remain independent for another century.\nIn Europe, the Mongol conquest had a profound impact on the political landscape.

Jazz quickly became popular throughout the United States, and by the 1920s it had spread to Europe.\nThe history of jazz is closely tied to the history of African Americans in the United States. It was a way for black people to express their culture and identity in the face of oppression and discrimination. Jazz musicians often faced challenges due to racism and segregation, but they also found ways to innovate and thrive.\nJazz has had a profound impact on American culture. It has been used as a vehicle for social commentary, political protest, and cultural expression. It has also been embraced by audiences around the world, and has become an important part of the global music scene.\nToday, jazz continues to evolve and adapt, with new artists pushing the boundaries of the genre.

One of these scientists is Stephen Hawking, who has stated that we only have 1,000 years left to colonize space before we're wiped out by our own planetary problems.\nStill, even if we don't manage to colonize space until we solve those problems, it's likely we will develop the technology to detect and communicate with other intelligent life in the universe.

This jocular observation can sometimes be taken too far. A prominent physicist told me recently that he thought quantum computers would never work because “nobody understands quantum mechanics,” and yet somehow we build quantum devices and control their behavior with near-perfect fidelity. (He was unimpressed when I tried to explain about measurements and decoherence.) So maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise that there are some computer scientists who don't believe P=NP, despite the overwhelming preponderance of evidence; after all, nobody really understands quantum mechanics either. And perhaps I'm uniquely susceptible to this kind of psychological manipulation, but the more I read David Cherry's new paper, “The P = BPP? Hypothesis,” the less I'm convinced that his arguments constitute a serious challenge to the standard model of computation.\nThe basic idea behind Cherry's paper is that P != NP unless one adds extra structure to the class of problems solvable in polynomial time. Not only does this structure have to make a difference when it comes to hard instances of NP-complete problems, but it has to do so in a way that gives rise to a subexponential-size circuit for most Boolean functions. There's already a lot of interesting physics here—for instance, we want a subclass of NP whose problems are easy to simulate on a quantum Turing machine, but we also don't want it to be too small!—"

A lot of the criticism I've seen is that it didn't really follow the books, so I'm going to try a version that does. The main points are:\n1) Dany goes mad and turns evil 2) Jon kills her 3) Cersei dies 4) Tyrion becomes king 5) Aegon VI becomes King of the Andals &amp; the First Men 6) Westeros is reunited under Targaryen rule again 7) The Others are defeated\nThis is set around 300 years after the end of the show. The theory is that Daenerys' line died out, as did all other Targaryen lines except for possibly Aegon VI (Jon Snow).\nThe story follows two children of the North: Sansa Stark and Arya Stark. They are both grown up and far apart - Sansa in Winterfell and Arya in Braavos. There are also flashbacks to their childhood with Ned Stark and the events leading up to the war of the Five Kings.\nThe White Walkers have been defeated, but the lands beyond the Wall are still dangerous. The Night's Watch have built new castles and keep a watchful eye on everything north of the Wall.\nSansa meets Lord Petyr Baelish at Winterfell, where he reveals that he was secretly married to Catelyn Stark and is therefore her son, making him the half-brother of Robb Stark and thus uncle to Sansa and Arya. He explains that he helped to arrange the marriage between Eddard and Catelyn"

Today’s post comes from miketyson, who argues against legalization.\nA few weeks ago I was driving down the street in my car when I noticed a large billboard advertising a marijuana dispensary. The ad read something like this: “Come visit our friendly neighborhood pot shop today!” It made me wonder just how much of a “friendly” neighborhood marijuana is actually creating. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that most Americans (52%) believe that marijuana use should be made legal while 45% say it should not be legal. This seems to indicate that there is an even split between those for and against legalization. However, when I look at social media, I see no shortage of pro-marijuana legalization articles and memes being shared. And indeed, support for marijuana legalization has been steadily growing over the last few years. I find it hard to believe that we are currently at an even split, so who is correct? Is marijuana use really harmless? In my opinion, marijuana use should not be legalized for recreational purposes.\nThere are many reasons why people choose to use marijuana. Some people use marijuana as a form of pain management, others use it to help them sleep, some use it to help relieve stress or anxiety, and many others use it for fun. While some people may view marijuana as a harmless past time, it can have a number of negative side effects.

The amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft changes only with the amount of dopamine released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, which depends on how many dopamine receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter.\nThe actual release of dopamine is less than 1% of the total amount that was stored in vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, measuring brain dopamine levels would require the injection of extremely large amounts of dopamine into the brain to measure any change in brain levels. Also, dopamine is widely distributed in the brain and has multiple functions which vary depending on its location. For example, high levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex have been associated with reduced impulsivity, while high levels in the striatum are associated with reduced motor activity."

It is also about beautiful ideas that have deep meanings. One such idea is that of infinity. Infinity is a concept that has intrigued humans since ancient times. The idea of “something that goes on forever” is beautiful in its simplicity. And when mathematicians started to explore this idea further, they found that there were many different kinds of infinity. There is “countably infinite”, which means that you can put a one-to-one correspondence between the numbers and the objects (like the integers and the points of a line). Then there is “uncountably infinite”, which is bigger than countably infinite. For example, the real numbers are uncountably infinite — you cannot put them into one-to-one correspondence with the counting numbers. But there are even more kinds of infinity. For example, how big is infinity? This is a famous question that has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Some say that infinity is larger than anything else. Others say that it cannot be compared to anything else because it is completely different. One particularly beautiful kind of infinity is transfinite infinity. This is a bit tricky to explain, but I will give it a try. Imagine that you have a set of all the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …). Now we can create a new set by adding a new element called “aleph-null”. So far so good.

The Onion Futures Act was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1958, and it has never been repealed despite numerous other commodity futures laws being struck down or repealed since then.\nThe reasons why onions have special treatment is that:\nOnions are a \"perishable\" item, and are easily spoiled or wasted before they can be delivered to market.\nOnions are not widely consumed in the United States, so there is little price risk protection for farmers or hedging for buyers.\nTherefore, there is insufficient demand for onion futures trading.\nLack of demand for onion futures means smaller volume, and therefore lower fees for traders. This means fewer people will offer their services as a broker/trader for onion futures.\nOverall, this lack of interest in trading onion futures makes it less likely that onion futures contracts will ever be profitable enough to attract legislation to repeal the act.\n\"The Onion Futures Act was passed in 1958 because the U.S. Congress recognized that onions were different from other commodities.\" - I think this quote comes from Wikipedia, but I can't find it there.

Starting with C, the first note of the C scale, there are three ways to play C: C, C# (D♭), and C♮ (D). Continuing up the scale, each note has three more possibilities, giving us:\n\nC, D, E, F, G, A, B, C♯, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭, C\nThen going back down, we get:\n\nC, B♭, A♭, G♭, F♭, E♭, D♭, C♯, B, A, G, F, E, D, C\nAnd going back up again:\n\nC, B, A, G, F, E, D, C♯, B♯, A♯, G♯, F♯, E♯, D♯, C\nSo there are 12 different notes when starting on C, and any time you transpose a note by a semitone, you have another note. This gives us 36 different notes per octave.\nIf we start on any other note, say A, then the first three notes are:\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A\nTransposing up and down from A gives us all the other keys as well.\nThis means that if we were to play a major or minor chord with every note in the octave, it would take 36 x 36 = 12"

However, there are two problems with your proposed method:\nThe first problem is that, while driving, the underside of the car will be exposed to much less road salt than when parked.

Additionally, certain strains of gut bacteria have been shown to have beneficial effects on the immune system and digestion. So while we may not fully understand the exact role of the appendix and gut bacteria in human health, there is evidence to suggest that they are closely linked and may be important for overall health and well-being."
