Developing innovative educational tools and software that can help students learn STEM subjects more effectively.\n2. Creating a platform for online learning and teaching that focuses on STEM subjects.\n3. Offering online courses or workshops for teachers to improve their skills in teaching STEM subjects.\n4. Developing a program for summer camps or after-school activities that promote STEM education among children.\n5. Providing tutoring services or virtual classes for students who need extra help with STEM subjects.\n6. Developing a mobile application that provides interactive quizzes, games, and activities related to STEM subjects.\n7. Creating a subscription-based service that offers access to high-quality STEM resources and materials."

This page details how to make them yourself, and also has instructions for making other types of POV goggles.\nPersistence of Vision Goggles: A simple and cheap way to see 3-D from your computer. Persistence of vision goggles or POV goggles allow you to see an image in 3 dimensions when viewed through them. The secret is that they alternate between two slightly different images very quickly so your brain sees them as one 3-dimensional image.\nThe first person to figure out how to create the illusion of depth using a moving image was Horace... He invented the \"persistence of vision\" or POV 3D technique, which uses the phenomenon that our brains perceive a continuous image when presented with a rapid succession of still images."

In this case, we want to validate an email address using a regular expression in Python. Here's an example regular expression that should work for most email addresses:\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\nThis regular expression matches:\n- An empty line or any string starting with \"from email@\"\n- One or more characters from the set of `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]` (letters, digits, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and hyphens)\n- One or more `@` symbols\n- One or more characters from the set of `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]` (letters and digits)\n- One or more `.` periods\n- One or more characters from the set of `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` (two or more letters)\n- An empty line or the end of the string\n\nTo use this regular expression in Python, you can define a function that takes an email address as input and uses the regular expression to validate it. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport re\ndef validate_email(email):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate an email address using a regular expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    pattern = r^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n    if re.fullmatch(pattern, email):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\nYou can call this function with an email address as input, like this:\n```python\n>>>"

The ISIS member stands watch over them, his AK-47 resting on his shoulder, finger on the trigger. He can't help but feel a sense of pride that he has managed to capture so many people. He knows he should kill them all, but something inside him won't allow it. Instead, he continues to stare at them, wondering what they would do if they had the chance to take back their lives.\n\nOne by one, the hostages stare back at him, their eyes filled with fear and hatred. Some try to make eye contact, while others look away in shame. One man begs him to let them go, promising that they won't tell anyone what happened. But the ISIS member knows that no one would believe them anyway. They wouldn't understand.\n\nSuddenly, there is a sound from outside the building - gunfire and screams. He knows that the army has arrived, and his time is up. With a sigh, he raises his weapon and begins firing into the crowd. As their bodies hit the floor, he feels a strange sense of relief wash over him. He never understood why people said it was better to die than to live this way. Now he knows."
