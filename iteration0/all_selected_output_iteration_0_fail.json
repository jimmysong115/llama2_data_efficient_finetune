        "input": "",
        "output": "1. With MS Word running, select File from the menu bar in the top left corner of the screen.  Then, choose New.  This will give you a choice as to which style and layout you want the document to be created in.\n2. In the search bar, type the word “screenplay.”  Currently, Microsoft offers one premade screenplay template for MS Word 2013/2016.  Double click on it after the search is completed.  This will launch the screenplay-formatted document.\nIn MS Word 2010, the steps are essentially the same.  Open a new document, then select templates, and search Microsoft Office Online.  Choose one of the two available, then download it.\n3. There are no hard and fast rules governing the style in which screenplays are produced, though there are general guidelines, vocabulary, and common features.  Check with the specific studio you’re writing for to find out how to customize your specific document.  Think about how to adjust margins, font size, fonts, and line spacing.\n4. If you’ve already written or have a screenplay saved on your hard drive, open it in MS Word.  In Word 2013/2016, click File > Save As > Computer.  Type a name for your template in the file name box.  Then, in the drop-down “save as type” menu just below the file name box, select Word Template.  If the document contains macros, select Word Macro-Enable Template.  Click save.\nIf you want to change the location where your template will be saved, click File > Options > Save and type the folder path you want to use in the default personal templates location box.\n5. If you’re unhappy with the template layout provided by Word, you can modify the style and formatting of your document in order to create new formatting patterns.  These patterns could be used again if you save them, or you can create a new template based on a document which uses these style and formatting rules.  You could think of formatting as creating your own template.\n6. The text might be a character name, a piece of dialogue, or some stage directions.  Select the line of text by clicking the left button on your mouse with your cursor at the left edge of the line of text.\n\nAlternately, you could highlight the text by clicking the left button of your mouse to the right or left of the line of text you want to adjust.\nFinally, you could highlight text by bringing up a blinking cursor within the text you’ve written and holding down the shift key and an arrow key to highlight the text you want to format.  To highlight text to the left of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the left directional button.  To highlight text to the right of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the right directional arrow.\nIf you have multiple lines of text, you can select them at one time and apply the formatting changes you desire to all highlighted lines.\n7. With your text highlighted, click on the word “Format” on the menu bar.  The drop down menu will display several options.  Click on the words “Styles and Formatting.”  This will open the Styles and Formatting pane.\nAlternately, you can open the Styles and Formatting pane by clicking the Styles and Formatting button on the toolbar.  Just click the Styles and Formatting button located next to the script character drop-down menu to open the pane.  The button is found at the far left edge of the toolbar.  It contains two letter “A”s, each of a different color, with one positioned above and to the left of the other.\n8. Right click on the still-highlighted text you selected initially.  A drop-down menu will open with a number of options.  The bottom-most option reads “Select Text with Similar Formatting.”  Click on this option with the left button of your mouse.  All text with formatting similar to that which you highlighted originally will become highlighted.\nSo, for instance, if you have all character names in a certain font and size centered exactly above a line of text, you can highlight a single instance of any character’s name, then use the “Select text with similar formatting” option to adjust all character names in your screenplay at once.\n9. After you’ve highlighted all the text you want to assign a given style, choose a style from the pane on the right.  The Styles and Formatting pane should still be open on the right of the screen.  Choose the style format you want to change the highlighted text to by left-clicking on it.\n10. If your highlighted text does not conform to an extant style, you can assign the formatting and style within the highlighted text a name by clicking the button near the top of the pane which reads “New Style.”  You can then assign a name, align the text to left or right, choose your font, and make other adjustments as you see fit.\n11. Typically in a screenplay, the master scene heading (also known as a slug line) is the series of words which broadly identify the content which follows.  For instance, scene headings might read “INT. OFFICE - DAY” (interior office during the day).  This helps orient the screenplay’s reader to the scene.\nScene headings should, as in the aforementioned example, be in all caps, two lines down from the last line of dialogue or description in the previous scene.\n12. A macro is a sequence of saved commands which can be executed immediately by assigning them to a single keystroke.  To prepare your macro, set your margins.  Format page margins by clicking on the Layout tab, then Margins, then Custom Margins. The top, bottom and right margins should be set at 1\". The left margin should be set to 1.5\". Set font to Courier New, 12 point.  These choices are standard in screenplays.  If you’d like to work with a different layout, set your margins accordingly.\nIn Word 2007, prepare to record the macro by setting your margins.  Format page margins by clicking on the Page Layout tab, then set the margins and font to the designations listed above.  Then open the Developer tab. Display the Developer tab by opening the office button (the top left button), Word Options (at the bottom), under Popular check Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.\n13. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for setting up scenes, assigning the name “Scene heading” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro.  This button is located on the left side of the developer tab.  Store the macro in Document 1 (instead of Normal, so that you can save it as a distinct screenplay template). Name the macro 'Scene' or 'Heading'. Click the keyboard icon to assign the macro to a keyboard shortcut.  You can then press the keyboard button you wish to assign to the macro.  For example, perhaps you want to bind F2 to your macro.  In the “Press New Shortcut Key” box, press F2 to bind it.  Click Assign, then Close.\n14. Then assign the macro to F2 (or whatever button you want to assign it to) using the “Press New Shortcut Key” clickable box.  Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\n15. Press Enter on your keyboard twice to skip two lines.  Go back into Page Layout tab (Layout tab in Word 2007)and change both indentations back to 0.  Open the Home tab.  Click on the bottom right corner of the Font section to open the dialog box. Then in the Effects section, check All Caps and click OK.\n16. Click the View tab again.  Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F2 (your shortcut key) will now skip two lines down the page and capitalize text, preparing you to enter a scene heading.\nIn Word 2007, go back to the Developer tab.  Click Stop Recording. F2 (your shortcut key) will now skip two lines down and capitalize the text.\n17. Description in a screenplay offers more info than does the simple scene heading.  It might offer details about the type of lighting, weather conditions, or other descriptions of the physical location of the scene and its characters.  Description is located two lines below the scene heading in a standard sentence format, with the first letter capitalized and a period at the end.  For instance, below a scene heading  like “INT. OFFICE - DAY” we might read descriptive info such as “The window is open and the lights are flickering on and off.”\n18. In the bottom right corner of the Paragraph section, click the little icon that opens the dialog box.  Set 1’’ indents before text and 1.5’’ after text under the Indentation section.\nIn Word 2007, display the Developer tab.  Click the Office button at the top left, then go to Word Options (at the bottom), then under Popular, check “Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.”\n19. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for description, assigning the name “Description” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\n20. Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro on the left side of the ribbon.  Store the macro in the same place you stored the other macro you created, and name it “Description.” Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F3.\n21. Hit Enter twice on your keyboard to skip a couple lines, then go to the Layout tab (Page Layout tab in Word 2007) and move both indentations to 0.  Next, click on the Home tab.  In the bottom right corner of the Font section, select the little icon which opens the dialog box to open it.  Look under the Effects section, then deselect All Caps.  Click OK.\nIn word 2007, after deselecting All Caps, return to the Developer tab and press Stop Recording before continuing with the rest of the above directions.\n22. Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F3 will now skip two lines down the page and be lowercase.  If you do not bind the macro to the F3 key, F3 will not be useful as a hotkey to setup descriptive passages in your screenplay.\nIn Word 2007, return to the Developer tab and press Stop Recording instead of clicking Macros > Stop Recording.\n23. Characters and their dialogue or actions typically follow the introduction and descriptive info which sets a scene.  They should be centered in all caps on the page with dialogue following on the line below.\n\nTo create a macro which will prepare you to input character names after writing scene description, repeat the same steps used to create a macro for description in MS Word 2013/2016, but:\n\na) after changing the indentation back to 0 during recording, press the space bar 22 times, then select the All Caps and\nb) name the macro 'Character' and assign it to F4. Be sure that the first thing done during recording is to skip down two lines.\n\n\nAfter pressing Stop Recording, F4 will skip two lines down the page (thus bringing the cursor to the correct character name position) and capitalize.\nTo create a dialogue macro for Word 2007, follow the directions for the description macro in Word 2007 but input the parameters outlined in the sub-steps above.\n24. In the bottom right corner of the Paragraph section, there’s a little icon.  Click it and a dialog box will open.  Set 1’’ indents before text and 1.5’’ after text under the Indentation section.\nIn Word 2007, display the Developer tab.  At the top left of the Word window, there’s a multicolored button known as the Office button.  Click it and go to Word Options (at the bottom).  Under Popular, check “Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.”\n25. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for dialogue, assigning the name “Dialogue” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\n\nClick the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F5.  Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro.  The button to record the macro is on the left side of the ribbon.  Store the Macro in the same place you stored the other macro you created, and name it “Description.”  Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro a button of your choice.  For example, maybe you want to use F5.  Click within the “Press New Shortcut Key” and then press the F5 button to assign this macro to F5.\n26. Hit Enter once on your keyboard to skip a line, then go into the Page Layout tab and move both indentations to 0.  Next, click on the Home tab.  In the bottom right corner of the Font section, select the little icon which opens the dialog box to open it.  Look under the Effects section, then select All Caps.  Click OK.\n\nClick the View tab again.  Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F5 will now skip one line, utilize lowercase text, and prepare you to enter dialogue.\nIn Word 2007, instead of clicking Macros > Stop Recording, press Stop Recording in the Developer tab.\n"

        "instruction": "For someone who is new to play video games, what would be 22 key steps to get started?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Choosing a video game or learning to play it can overwhelm someone unfamiliar with them. Fortunately, the vast number of options also means that  there is almost certainly a game you love. With a little direction and advice, you can start exploring a virtual world in no time.\n1. Choose a platform.: Playing video games no longer requires a dedicated console or a souped-up gaming computer. There are an increasing number of quality games available for your laptop, old computer, smartphone, or tablet. Get a taste for these first before you shell out hundreds of dollars for a console or computer upgrades. Once you've decided to explore new territory, keep the following in mind:\n\nFor the largest number of available games, get a desktop computer running the latest operating system, and install a good video card.\nFor a cheap, easy to set up option, purchase a console. Choose a latest-generation console (PS4, Switch, or Xbox One) to play new games, or an old one (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 or even earlier) for a large selection of cheap, used classics.\nChoose a handheld gaming system for a specific game you can't get on your phone.\n2. Check the game rating.: Game rating systems vary between each country, but an explanation should be available on the packaging or online description. Games rated M for mature or for an age range 17 or higher typically contain extreme violence or disturbing scenes.\n3. Read the system requirements.: If you are using a console, you should be able to play any game for that console. Computer gamers need to find out their computer specifications and check them against the requirements on the game packaging or website. There are typically two sets of requirements listed:\n\n\"Required\" lists the bare minimum. If you fall short of any of these requirements, don't purchase the game. If you barely meet these requirements, the game will probably be slow and/or look much worse than trailers and screenshots show.\n\"Recommended\" requirements should let you play the game with shorter loading times, no lag or visual glitches, and better graphics settings.\n4. Watch video reviews.: Games are a huge business, and the actual gameplay sometimes fails to live up to marketing hype. Find at least one review before you purchase an expensive game, preferably a video one so you can watch the gameplay first hand.\n5. Hear about new games and old classics.: If you have gamer friends, you'll probably hear about new games whether you like it or not. Other sources of information include gaming blogs and magazines, which you can find with a quick online search, or browsing the vast collection of computer games on Steam, the free game store.\n6. Feel free to jump into sequels.: Don't feel obligated to play the first game in a series. The sequels often have improved gameplay and graphics, and often don't even follow the previous story directly.\n7. Be cautious with competitive games.: If you don't consider yourself a gamer, there are certain genres that you may not enjoy. First-person shooters, fighting games, \"battle arenas\" like League of Legends, and to a lesser extent sports games tend to be fiercely competitive. These are often extremely difficult for a new player to learn.\n\nIf you have your heart set on learning one of these genres, pick one with a single-player mode that lets you learn on your own, such as Halo.\nSome specific games in different genres fall into this category as well. The Starcraft and Dark Souls series are not recommended for inexperienced gamers.\n8. Try before you buy.: If you're uncertain about a game, look for a free demo version. If this isn't available, consider renting the game from the Gamefly website, or from a brick-and-mortar store.\n9. Play free introductory games.: If you've never got into a video game before, you might want to try a few free ones first to see what you enjoy. A quick search online or in an app store for \"free games\" will give you thousands of results, but here are a few suggestions you should be able to find in an online search:\n\nPuzzle games are easy to find in mobile app stores or online flash game sites. If you've had your fill of classics like Tetris and Minesweeper, try Loops of Zen, 3D Logic, Lightbot, and many more.\n\nMost free action games on mobile or online aren't great introductions to their more \"gamer\"-oriented counterparts. If you have a decent computer, Path of Exile is a more expansive introduction.\n\nIf you like strategy, try Hearthstone (collectible card game), Plants vs Zombies (tower defense), or Battle for Wesnoth (turn-based strategy). All three are available for both computer and mobile platforms, and most versions are free.\n10. Find more puzzle games.: Some of the biggest casual \"coffee break\" puzzle games include Candy Crush and 2048. Take it to three dimensions and add a quirky story to discover the acclaimed Portal and Portal 2. If nothing but the most cerebral and fiendishly difficult will do, play Braid.\n11. Search for action games.: This is a broad and popular genre. If you like fighting and platforming (leaping and climbing around), look no further. The atmosphere and setting of these games ranges from horror (The Last of Us) to family-friendly (Legend of Zelda) to historical (Assassin's Creed). If you like testing your reflexes but don't really care about story or immersive experiences, try a competitive first-person shooter (such as Call of Duty) or a family-friendly platformer (such as Super Mario Galaxy).\nIf you'd rather mess around or have fun with friends than explore and follow a story, try Super Smash Brothers (family friendly) or Grand Theft Auto (the opposite of family friendly).\n12. Play story-based games.: Enjoy sprawling fantasy settings? Play Dragon Age or Skyrim for a pseudo-medieval experience, or one of the more recent Final Fantasy games for the Japanese take. Bioshock 2 or Bioshock: Infinite are more unsettling examples set in utopias gone wrong.\n13. Pick up a few strategy games.: Build an empire with turn-based strategy in Civilization V or Civilization: Beyond Earth. Test your reflexes with fast-paced \"real-time strategy\" games such as the challenging multi-player game Starcraft II. Try any Total War game to test your single-player tactical skills or play the role of famous historical figures.\n14. Try games of exploration and creativity.: If you don't care about graphics, there are few games more appealing than Minecraft when it comes to building a world. Maybe controlling a house and family in The Sims 2 is more up your alley, or perhaps you'd prefer a more detailed world and atmosphere in Sunless Sea.\n15. Play a multiplayer online role-playing game.: World of Warcraft popularized this genre, in which you play online with thousands of other players. WoW is still around alongside Star Wars: The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, and many, many others. Most of these are partially free to play, but find out what the full version's payment system is like before you get involved. These games are infamously addictive, and once you're hooked you might find yourself spending a great deal of money on monthly subscription payments or in-game purchases.\n16. Learn to play.: Most games have tutorials that will walk you through the game play. If you prefer to learn on your own, read the instruction manual, or look for the \"documentation\" section on the main menu or website.\n17. Dim the lights (optional).: This is recommended for adventure and horror games especially. Besides a greater feeling of immersion, this will cut down on glare interfering with your ability to see the screen.\n18. Turn down the difficulty if you like.: Games don't have to be about suffering or pushing yourself to the limit. If you're playing a video game to unwind, set it to Easy difficulty. The harder difficulty levels are often intended to be difficult challenges for people who have played similar games for years.\nIf the game has both single-player and multi-player options, the single-player portion is almost always easier.\n19. Change the controls if necessary.: You can ignore this step until it's an issue, but if you find yourself hitting the wrong button or straining your fingers, visit the menu options. There's almost always an option to change the controls to whichever key you find easiest.\n\nA laptop trackpad makes it extremely difficult to play some games. An actual mouse is a big improvement.\nIf you like the feel of a console controller, these are available to plug in to your computer as well, if you have the right adapter. Not all games support this, however.\n20. Save often.: Most games have an auto-save feature that will save your progress regularly. If it also has the option to save manually, do so often. There's nothing worse than losing hours of progress because your system crashes or the power goes out.\nIf you have the option to use multiple save slots, create three or four and rotate between them. This lets you load an old save to explore a different story branch, or recover your game even if a bug screws up your most recent save.\n21. Explore and experiment.: One of the most appealing features of video games compared to other art forms is the ability to insert hidden content that you have to actively search for and discover. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of your games:\n\nIn platformers, role-playing games, or even racing games, try to move through or attack walls that look out of place with their surroundings.\nIn strategy games and action/adventure games, try new tactics even if they don't seem great. The later parts of the game (or harder competition) often require the ability to recognize when an unusual weapon or strategy has a chance to shine.\nIn games where you can talk to \"NPCs\" (non-player characters), use every dialogue option and read closely for hints.\n22. Get help when you're stuck.: Unless your only goal is bragging rights, why spend hours losing to the same fight or stuck on the same puzzle? Search for the game name and the word \"walkthrough\" online, and you'll find strategy advice or answers for every part of the game. If you prefer to solve it mostly on your own, ask friends or gaming forums for hints and advice. Hints and advice can make the game easier!\nIf it's not possible to follow the walkthrough advice (such as talking to a dead character), or if you are following the instructions but nothing is happening, it could be a bug. Search online for a description of your situation and you might find other players who can help you fix it.\n"

        "instruction": "Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what are relevant dimensions influencing the skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable?",
        "input": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

        "instruction": "Could you outline 16 practical steps to achieve tell your girlfriend that you love her?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Telling your girlfriend that you love her can be one of the most nerve-racking experiences you’ve had in a relationship. You’ll be tempted to overthink it, make crazy and expensive plans, or even tell her in a subtle way that might not come across the way you want it to. Instead, you should be direct and honest, trust your feelings, and pick an appropriate place to tell her. After all, if she feels the same way, then you don’t need an elaborate plan and you won’t need to find the perfect moment.\n1. Time your moment based on how long you’ve been in the relationship.: One of the biggest questions people have is when (how long into the relationship) they should tell their significant other that they love them. This, though, varies from men to women. One study has noted that men take 88 days to tell their girlfriends that they love them, while women take significantly longer. As a result of this, you need to make sure that you’re not rushing the relationship:\n\nMake sure she’s sent signals to you that she feels the same, even if she hasn’t told you that she loves you.\nDon’t tell her you love her during the first couple of weeks of dating. This is far too soon, and inappropriate. While there may be some couples who are sure of their love so early on, chances are, it’s not you.\nIf it feels too early, it probably is too early to tell her you love her. Wait a bit longer. If she feels the same way, it can’t hurt to wait a little bit.\n2. Tell her when you feel the relationship is solid, you are connected, and you want to move to the next level.: Perhaps the best time to tell her you love her is when you feel comfortable in your relationship and want to move it to the next level. There is no specific timeline on this, and it varies from relationship to relationship, so you need to gauge your own relationship and your comfort level before telling her you love her.\n3. Wait for the appropriate (specific) moment.: Telling her that you love her is not something you want to rush. You need to wait for an appropriate moment in which you’ll be able to express yourself and she’ll be able to respond. While you want to wait for an appropriate moment, consider:\n\nThat there is no “perfect” moment. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, you might wait forever.\nDon’t tell her when her complete attention is not on you.\nDon’t tell her when you’re in the process of coming into contact with other people.\nConsider a natural pause in the conversation after she’s said something sweet to you. This way, your admission of love will be a reciprocation of her own feelings.\n4. Wait until the two of you are alone.: Letting her know that you love her should be something you tell her when you’re alone. This doesn’t mean that you have to be completely isolated from everyone when you tell her, but you certainly want to have at least a low level of intimacy between the two. Consider:\n\nNever tell her in front of a group of friends.\nDon’t tell her when you are in front of your or her family.\nGenerally, the less people the better. If you’re alone talking in a crowd, that’s okay. But if you’re the center of attention in the crowd, that might be a bit awkward for one or both of you.\n5. Let it be natural.: If at all possible, you should let her know about how you feel in a natural way. While you’re going to probably think about doing it ahead of time, try not to script it out word for word and time it to the exact minute. It will come across as more sincere if it seems natural.\n6. Make sure you are sober and alert.: The best time to say “I love you” is when you’re sober and alert. There are a number of reasons for this. If you’re not sober and alert, you might botch the delivery. If you’re drunk or tired, your girlfriend might question your motives or think that you don’t really mean what you’re saying.\n\nDon’t be drunk and say “I love you.” Of course, a glass of wine or a beer should be alright (if you’re of age).\nDon’t say “I love you” after you’ve been partying.\nThe more alert you are, the chances are the better you’ll be able to convey your true feelings.\n7. Accompany it with a gift.: Some men prefer to give their girlfriend a gift, present it, and then tell their lady how much she means to him. This is certainly an acceptable way of conveying your love. However, consider:\n\nInexpensive thoughtful gifts that are homemade or represent something in your relationship.\nA necklace or bracelet (if you know she’s been interested in something like this).\nIt might come off as contrived.\nDon’t make your gift too grandiose, because it could seem like you are trying to buy her.\nTry not to make a spectacle out of presenting the gift, this could be embarrassing.\nOnly you know your relationship dynamic, so use your best judgement based on both of your comfort levels and expectations.\n8. Trust your gut.: Telling your girlfriend you love her is something you don’t want to overthink. If you overthink it, it might come off awkward or contrived. Instead, trust your feelings and your intuition. If it feels like the right moment to tell her you love her, then do it.\n9. Invite her to a romantic dinner.: A romantic dinner is a wonderful place to tell your girlfriend that you love her. It’ll set the atmosphere, give you both time to talk and enjoy each other’s company, and give you the opportunity to tell her.\n\nA nice restaurant that you both enjoy will work great.\nConsider a home cooked meal.\nIf cooking at home, try to set the meal apart from everyday meals you might already enjoy together. If appropriate, light a candle and put on some lite music.\n10. Invite her on a picnic.: Picnics are a nice of way of spending time together with an atmosphere that suggests intimacy but is not too suggestive. Chances are, you’ll both enjoy the picnic, and use it as a time to talk and bond more than you have already. It might create the perfect opportunity to give her your news.\n11. Tell her when you’re engaged in light intimacy at one of your homes.: Perhaps you want to let her know in the heat of the moment – when you’re kissing or making out. This works for some people, but there are some potential pitfalls you need to be careful about.\n\nDon’t expect sex. She could think that you are saying it in order to butter her up for sex.\nDon’t tell her during sex. This could come off as insincere.\nDon’t tell her immediately after sex. Instead, wait a few hours at minimum, or even a couple of days.\nMake sure it comes out naturally, and not as some grand sexual plan for the evening.\n12. Avoid telling her at sports events, parties, or movies.: There are a number of reasons why you should avoid entertainment venues for this sort of thing. Most importantly, her attention won’t be on you. But there are other reasons as well:\n\nYou both might be under the scrutiny of others, which could be awkward.\nIf she’s a private person, she might be mad that you shared such a big thing with the whole world.\nOnly you know your relationship and your significant other, so use your best judgement.\n13. Consider a grandiose moment, if you think it’s appropriate.: If you’re both over-the-top, out-going, and flamboyant personalities, then maybe you can consider a grandiose moment to tell her you love her. While this is not recommended for most people, it might be right for you – but ultimately, only you know your relationship and your significant other. If you are the type of person who wants to do this, consider:\n\nHiring a plane trailing a sign “I love you <name>” over a sporting event or some other event where you and your girlfriend will be outside.\nSending her dozens of roses with a card that says I love you. If you want to go really over the top, you can send this to her work. It might be inappropriate, though.\nThere are many other over-the-top ways of conveying your love, just make sure you think it’s right for your relationship.\n14. Tell her directly, at the right time and the right place.: If you think it’s the right time and place, just tell her directly, “I love you.” This is extremely direct, but it’s simple and it will convey what you are feeling. Of course there are a few ways to slightly soften this direct approach:\n\nSay something like “I have a confession to make…” then “I love you.”\nAsk her for her hand, and tell her you love her.\nLead into a conversation about how you see the rest of your life, and then tell her you love her.\n15. Let her know indirectly.: You can tell her you love her in an indirect approach, if you feel more comfortable doing so. However, be warned. While this might alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for you, it might take some of the magic out of the moment. If you do go with the indirect approach, consider:\n\nSpelling “I love you” on a mirror or another surface.\nSending her flowers with a card that says “I love you.”\nWrite her a “love letter” and snail mail it to her.\nUnderstand that an indirect approach could be construed as a grandiose admission of love, too.\n16. Communicate your love nonverbally.: Sharing your love in a nonverbal way is something many people do. There are pros and cons to this approach. First, a nonverbal signal of love might mean more than just mere words. However, it could also lack the force and emotion of a direct verbal approach. If you’re going to go nonverbal, consider:\n\nLooking into her eyes at the right moment. If you have a true connection, she’ll understand.\nHolding her and kissing her on the neck at the right moment and at the right place. Perhaps you’re on a beach watching the sunset. This action might say much more than words could communicate.\nBe warned that this approach might be considered a cop-out by some, and might not actually communicate what you want. Only you and your partner can know.\n"
