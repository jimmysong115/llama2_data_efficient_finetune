Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.",

        "output": "The rise of electric vehicles (or EVs) has been fueled by many factors -- including innovation, acceleration, design and tax breaks -- but the underlying assumption that electric vehicles are less harmful to the environment and may even mitigate global warming has been a primary motivator for hundreds of thousands of buyers.\n\nDespite the virtuous aura of owning an electric vehicle, the jury is still out on whether EVs have a net positive impact on the environment or will do anything to curtail climate change.  That's because, while the experience of driving an EV may feel like a zero-compromise embrace of green energy, the vast industrial network needed to build and power EVs diminishes the halo effect. On the other hand, the fossil fuels that power traditional vehicles are definitely contributing to global warming and leave the world vulnerable to oil shocks and pressure from oil-producing countries. \n\nWhether EVs are better or worse for the environment is still to be determined. But a more insidious trend is the growing size and power of electric vehicles. Smaller vehicles, traveling fewer miles, represents a proven formula for reducing emissions and reversing climate change. But already, we're seeing the advent of electric trucks and SUVs, which are heavier, loaded with bells and whistles so they require more and more power to move people around. Coupled with the problem of drivers feeling like their EV gives them the right to drive as much as they want and you can see a reality emerging where the problem of Americans driving giant gas guzzlers is being replaced with American driving giant, power-sucking EVs. And that's leading us even faster down the road to environmental disaster."

Generative AI systems use generative models such as large language models to statistically sample new data based on the training data set that was used to create them.\n\nNotable generative AI systems include ChatGPT, a chatbot built by OpenAI using the GPT-3 and GPT-4 large language models and Bard, a chatbot built by Google using the LaMDA model. Other generative AI models include artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.\n\nGenerative AI has potential applications across a wide range of industries, including software development, marketing, and fashion. Investment in generative AI surged during the early 2020s, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models.\n\nModalities\nA detailed oil painting of figures in a futuristic opera scene\nThéâtre d'Opéra Spatial, an image generated by Midjourney\nA generative AI system is constructed by applying unsupervised or self-supervised machine learning to a data set. The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the modality or type of the data set used.\n\nText: Generative AI systems trained on words or word tokens include GPT-3, LaMDA, LLaMA, BLOOM, GPT-4, and others (see List of large language models). They are capable of natural language processing, machine translation, and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks. Data sets include BookCorpus, Wikipedia, and others (see List of text corpora).\nCode: In addition to natural language text, large language models can be trained on programming language text, allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs. Examples include OpenAI Codex.\nImages: Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include such as Imagen, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and others (see Artificial intelligence art, Generative art, Synthetic media). They are commonly used for text-to-image generation and neural style transfer. Datasets include LAION-5B and others (See Datasets in computer vision).\nMolecules: Generative AI systems can be trained on sequences of amino acids or molecular representations such as SMILES representing DNA or proteins. These systems, such as AlphaFold, are used for protein structure prediction and drug discovery. Datasets include various biological datasets.\nMusic: Generative AI systems such as MusicLM can be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations, in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as \"a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff\".\nVideo: Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally-coherent video clips. Examples include Gen1 by RunwayML and Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms.\nMultimodal: A generative AI system can be built from multiple generative models, or one model trained on multiple types of data.

Traditionally in Object-Oriented programming, sub-typing would be used to create sub-classes that inherit the properties and methods of the base class. \n\nYou created instances of customShape, but didn't really make any objects that inherit that functionality. For instance, you made the triangle instance and added a function (like a method) to that one instance:\n\n\nvar triangle = new customShape();\ntriangle.noOfSides = function(){\n    return (\"Total No of Sides = \" + 3);\n}\n\n\n\nLooking at the fourth reference you included, look at the Padawan inheritance example\n\n\nvar jedi = function(name, age) {\n    Padawan.call(this, name, age);\n};\njedi.prototype = Object.create(Padawan.prototype);\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you could make a constructor for a triangle. The customShape constructor doesn't appear to accept any parameters, though it could accept the number of sides, in which case the triangle constructor could pass that in as an argument to the call to customShape.call(), but for now, the sides property can be set after that call.\n\nfunction triangle() {\n    //initialization code\n    customShape.call(this);\n    this.sides = 3;\n}\n\n\nAnd then set the prototype for the triangle to an object with the customShape prototype:\n\ntriangle.prototype = Object.create(customShape.prototype);\n\n\nThen you don't need to add an additional noOfSides() function for the triangle. See a demonstration below. Note that I updated the noOfSides() method to utilize this.sides instead of a hard-coded value (like Matt Fletcher mentioned in a comment on your SO question, and also did in the jsbin example he made and linked in another comment).\n\n\r\n\r\nvar customShape = function(){\n    this.sides = 4;\n    this.length = 5;\n  ",

        "instruction": "What is machine learning, and when did it first emerge?",
        "input": "Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that \"learn\" – that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.\n\nMachine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.\n\nA subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.\n\nSome implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.\n\nIn its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.\n\nOverview\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist\".\n\nMachine learning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.\n\nThe discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers. For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.\n\nHistory and relationships to other fields\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.\n\nBy the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called CyberTron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\n\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\n\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.

Adaptive Machine Translation (AMT): AMT is a machine learning-based approach that adapts to the user's language and writing style. This approach uses machine learning algorithms to learn from the user's previous translations and adjust the translation accordingly.\n3. Contextual Machine Translation: Contextual machine translation takes into account the context of the text being translated. This approach uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the context of the text and adjust the translation accordingly.\n4. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a machine learning approach that uses trial and error to learn the best translation. This approach involves training the machine learning algorithm to make the best translation based on feedback from the user.\nBy using these machine learning algorithms, real-time language translation can become more accurate and efficient, making it easier for people to communicate across different languages."
