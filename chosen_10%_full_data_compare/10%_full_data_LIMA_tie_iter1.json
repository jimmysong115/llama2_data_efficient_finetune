        "instruction": "Does Crimea belong to Russia?",
        "input": "",
        "output": " hopefully, the UN will send a fact-finding mission to Crimea and make its... Finding that Crimea is part of Russia would not only be consistent with both history and international law.\nCrimea is a peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014. This region was annexed by the Russian Federation despite the protests of the West. Many people assert that Crimea belongs to Ukraine, while others say it is Russian territory.\nEveryone knows the origins of this conflict: after the February coup in Kiev, which ousted democratically elected president Victor Yanukovich and installed a pro-European Union government, Crimea, which had long enjoyed considerable autonomy within Ukraine, voted overwhelmingly (97 percent) to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia.\nIn March 2014, following an armed takeover of state buildings in several Ukrainian cities, including Crimea's capital, Simferopol, Russia recognised the independence and sovereignty of Crimea following a referendum. The referendum results showed an overwhelming majority of Crimeans in favour of both joining the Russian Federation and of retaining the use of the Russian language. All these events were either ignored or justified, depending on the political position of the speaker.\nOn April 16th, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 declared that the referendum held in Crimea, on March 16th, 2014, was not in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution and could have no precedent value. In other words, the UN did not consider Crimea to be part of Russia because they didn't like the result of a popular vote.\nSo Crimea is a disputed territory and its status remains"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Nationalists and populists have always tried to use available technologies to spread their message. In the 1930’s, it was radio that provided them with a platform to reach out to the masses. Today, social media (and in particular Twitter) is used by many nationalist groups. The question is whether this is simply a matter of technology changing or there are deeper parallels between the two eras.\nIn the past, I have argued elsewhere that the link between nationalism and populism is overstated. Nationalists are often anti-elitist, but they do not necessarily support policies that are anti-establishment. Populists on the other hand can be either nationalists or anti-establishment. Geert Wilders fits quite well in the populist camp whereas Marine Le Pen is more of a nationalist.\nHowever, when looking at the use of social media, both nationalists and populists make use of it, although there may be differences between them.\nIn a recent paper, Cas Mudde analyses how populists make use of Twitter. They often follow a similar strategy: they tweet a lot, mostly about current affairs where they take a strong stand. The content of these tweets is very similar to the content of their party manifestos. This shows that populists are indeed using social media to spread their message.\nIn an article in Dutch newspaper Trouw, journalist Joost Oranje argues that the same is true for nationalists. He spoke to Jeroen Gelsing, who teaches new media at the University of Amsterdam, and asked him to analyse the accounts of nationalist leader Thierry Baudet and his party FvD. According to Gelsing, Baudet uses Twitter in a similar way as populists do, except that he does not criticise existing political institutions and politicians as much. Instead, he focuses"

        "input": "",
        "output": "The New York Times has a pretty good article on how to write such stories. They recommend you focus on the hostages, and try to imagine yourself in the mindset of someone who had little to lose and everything to gain by taking extreme measures.\nHere's my attempt:\nIt was a tense situation. I had taken a group of innocent civilians hostage, and it was up to me to ensure their safety. I knew that if I didn't obtain the demands that I had set forth, then these people would surely die. My heart ached for them, but I had no choice. No one did.\nI looked around the room at my captives. They were scared, but they were also defiant. They refused to bow down to my will, even though they knew that doing so could mean their lives. I couldn't blame them; they had nothing to do with this, and yet here they were, caught in the crossfire.\nBut still, they kept trying to reason with me. They tried to appeal to my humanity, to my sense of right and wrong. I wanted to listen to them, but I couldn't. I had made my decision, and there was no going back.\nAll I could do was hope that reason would ultimately prevail. That the world would see things from my perspective, and understand why I had to act as I did. Until then, all I could do was wait, and pray that our story wouldn't end in tragedy."
