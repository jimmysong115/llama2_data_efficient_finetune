You spend most of your time writing code that no one will ever see, and when people do look at your work, they complain that it's hard to understand and maintain. But don't worry - we can help you get back on track with some tips from seasoned developers.\nFirst and foremost, learn about dependency injection. It's a technique used in object-oriented programming to reduce coupling between objects. This means that your classes will be loosely coupled, which makes them easier to understand and modify. In C# terms, this means that you should create classes that have very few dependencies on other classes. Instead, you should inject dependencies into your classes using constructor injection or property injection.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that you should aim for high cohesion and low coupling. This means that your classes should only do one thing and should be tightly coupled with other classes that also do one thing. This makes it easy to understand what each class is responsible for and also makes it easy to change one part of your code without breaking anything else.\nFinally, remember that readability counts. Your code should be written in a way that someone can pick it up and understand it without any explanation. Use comments sparingly and only where necessary, and make sure that your variable and method names are clear and descriptive."

This means that a problem cannot be solved more easily by, say, solving a simpler problem first and then applying some basic rules to get the answer for the original problem, unless the two problems are in the same complexity class. To put it another way, if a problem is computationally irreducible, then any algorithm to solve it must work on examples of the problem directly, without being able to use shortcuts based on other problems."

It works by first creating a 3D model of the object, then using specialized software to slice the model into thin layers. The object is then printed layer by layer until the entire object is created. 3D Printing has revolutionized the way we manufacture products, and it has also opened up some exciting new opportunities for parents. For instance, now you can print your own personalized toys for your kids!\nThere are several online companies that allow you to create 3D models and then have them printed with various materials, including plastic, metal, and even food. One such company is Shapeways, which lets you design your toy on their website and then have it printed in either plastic or metal.\nAnother option is Sculpteo, which offers a wider range of materials, including nylon, bronze, and even chocolate. Sculpteo also allows you to create more complex designs than Shapeways, making it a better choice for more advanced users.\nRegardless of which company you choose, the process is relatively simple. First, you’ll need to create a free account on their website. Then, you’ll use their online designer tool to create your 3D model. Once you’re happy with your design, you can purchase it and have it printed. Shipping times vary depending on the material and size of the object, but most orders arrive within a few weeks.\nSo what kinds of toys can you create? The possibilities are virtually endless, but here are a few ideas:\n1. Clothes\n2. Dolls\n3. Action figures\n4. Building blocks\n5. Puzzles\n6. Board games\n7. T-shirts\n8. Keychains\n"

More Americans joined the labor force, and wage gains fell slightly. Those developments should help to further cool inflation. But the report also underscored the political and economic tensions for the president as he seeks to sell Americans on his economic stewardship ahead of an expected announcement this spring that he will seek re-election.",

        "output": "The report released Friday by the Labor Department showed that the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent, from 3.8 percent in February, as more people entered the labor force and found work. The sharp drop in job creation for March was a stark contrast from the previous two months when job gains totaled 500,000 in January and 740,000 in February. But it reflected a slowdown in hiring that had been expected because of forecasts of weaker economic growth after a strong start to the year.\nThe Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its meeting next week to try to cool the economy and bring down inflation, which stands at 6 percent for the fourth month in a row. A jump in prices for gasoline has pushed the overall consumer price index up even faster, by 1.4 percent in March, the most since 2006.\nStill, the job market remains resilient, with nearly half of all postings for jobs receiving a single application, according to data from ZipRecruiter, and there are now 1.7 openings for every unemployed person, near a record high. Many big employers are also competing fiercely for workers, raising wages and offering other perks, although pay has leveled off in recent months.\n“The report came in better than expected,” said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. “It’s not a disaster. It’s still a tight labor market.”\nIn March, the number of Americans who were working part time but wanted full-time positions rose by 389,000, and there were about 1.5 million fewer people on temporary layoff than before the pandemic.

First, there are often social and economic differences between the communities served by different school districts, and these can influence student performance.  For instance, there may be differences in access to health care, nutrition, and other factors that impact a child's readiness to learn when they enter school.  Second, resources play a role - some districts have more money to spend on facilities, teachers, and other resources than others.  Finally, leadership and management can make a big difference.  Having an effective principal and teachers who are good at their jobs can make a huge difference."

In this article, we’ll explore these issues and more as we examine the topic of vaccines in detail.\ncotton candy machine rental houston, As a parent, you’ve probably heard many different opinions on the topic of vaccines for your kids. Some people swear that they’re necessary and will prevent deadly diseases, while others maintain that they cause serious side effects and should be avoided at all costs. The truth is, there are pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but the big question is, which angle gives a clearer picture? Before we get into the specifics, let’s start with a few key points that everyone should agree on.\ncotton candy machine rental houston, 1. Vaccines are important: Even though it’s possible to contract a potentially deadly disease like polio or measles in the U.S., the risk is much higher if you travel to countries where these diseases are still common. If enough people get vaccinated, it’s much harder for a disease to spread.\n2. Vaccines aren’t foolproof: While vaccines can help protect against serious illnesses, they don’t guarantee 100 percent immunity and some people may still contract a disease. This is why herd immunity is so important.\n3. Getting vaccinated isn’t just about you: When you get vaccinated, you’re protecting those around you who may not be able to get v"

        "output": "ә (.)\nMedia platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have become increasingly important sources of news for many people. However, the way people consume and share news on social media can be influenced by a variety of factors, including algorithms, user behavior, and the design of the platform itself. This can lead to the spread of misinformation, as false or biased information can be easily amplified and shared by users. Additionally, social media platforms may be used to manipulate public opinion or spread propaganda through the use of bots or other automated means.\nThere are several potential implications of this phenomenon. Firstly, the spread of misinformation can lead to confusion and distrust in the news media more generally. Secondly, the use of social media as a tool for manipulation can undermine the democratic process and erode faith in electoral outcomes. Finally, the spread of misinformation can lead to real-world consequences, such as violence or harm to individuals or groups. It is therefore important that social media platforms take steps to combat the spread of misinformation and ensure that their users are exposed to accurate and reliable information."

In these cultures, traditional foods that are shared during these events may be more likely to be consumed, even if they are not the healthiest options. Similarly, in societies where there is limited access to fresh or affordable food options, people may rely more heavily on processed and pre-packaged foods, which may not always be the healthiest choices. Additionally, economic factors such as income, education, and access to grocery stores can also influence food choices. People with lower incomes may have limited access to fresh produce and may rely more heavily on less expensive, processed foods. Educational programs that teach people about the benefits of healthy eating and how to prepare nutritious meals can help to promote healthier diets, regardless of cultural, social, or economic backgrounds."

We are both scientists and we were excited to come here to study the planet and help prepare it for future colonization.\nWhen we first arrived, we lived in a temporary habitat that the Mars colony had set up for us. It was very basic, but it served its purpose. We had our own room, a common area, a kitchen, and a bathroom. The temperature inside was kept at a comfortable level by a special suit that we wore. We also had to wear this suit outside to protect ourselves from the harsh Martian environment.\nDuring the day, we would work in the lab, analyzing soil samples and studying the local flora and fauna. At night, we would sleep in our pods, which were like small rooms that could fold out into beds. We had to be careful not to disturb each other too much, as we were both still adjusting to the new environment.\nAfter about a month, we were able to move into a permanent habitat that the colony had built for us. This one was much more spacious and had all the modern conveniences of home. We had our own bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a kitchen. We could even grow some of our own food in the greenhouse.\nLife on Mars is certainly different from what we are used to on Earth, but we have adapted well. The biggest challenge is probably the lack of privacy. With only a few other colonists, we have to share everything, including bathrooms and communal areas.\nAnother challenge is the lack of recreational activities.

Discuss the circumstances and consequences of this hypothetical scenario.. to the Americas before Columbus.\nTo answer your question, it is important to understand that the Native Americans were not a single homogenous group of people, but rather a diverse collection of societies with their own distinct cultures, religions, and languages. If a Native American civilization had indeed crossed the Atlantic before Columbus, it is unlikely that they would have been able to establish a permanent settlement or colonize the Americas in the same way that Europeans did.\nThe Native Americans lacked the technology and knowledge to traverse the vast ocean, and even if they had managed to make such a journey, they would have faced extreme challenges in terms of survival. They would likely have had limited resources and knowledge of medicine, agriculture, and navigation, making it difficult to establish a sustainable colony.\nAdditionally, the arrival of the Europeans had a profound impact on the Native American societies, bringing with them diseases to which they had no immunity, as well as disrupting their way of life and cultural practices. It is possible that the arrival of a Native American civilization prior to Columbus could have led to conflict and tension with the Europeans, potentially resulting in the destruction of both cultures.\nOverall, while it is a fascinating hypothetical scenario, the consequences of such an event are difficult to predict and would likely have been complex and multifaceted."

NC is achieved when an external sound wave is exactly cancelled by a soundwave of opposite phase which is produced in the earpiece. The key components of ANC circuitry are a microphone, amplifier and a small loudspeaker. The sound picked up by the microphone is converted to an audio signal and fed into the ANC circuit. The amplifier boosts the audio signal so that it drives the loudspeaker, which produces a sound wave that is the exact inverse of the original sound wave. This sound wave acts as a 'anti-sound' wave, cancelling out the original sound. If the original sound wave was a car engine noise, the anti-sound wave will be a sound wave with the same amplitude but opposite phase. The sound waves overlap and cancel each other out, reducing the sound level reaching the listener's ears."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Following on from the previous discussion, it's clearly easier to play 7 major and 5 minor scales compared to having all 12 keys as major. Who decided on this?\nIt seems that the choice of 12 notes was made arbitrarily in order to fit with existing music theory and tuning - basically a social construct.\nWhy is there only 12 keys?\nBecause we conventionally use 12 notes per octave in Western classical music. The chromatic scale has 13 pitch classes, so if you start at A and count up or down you'd hit B (which is the same note) before finishing the scale. There are more than 12 different scales you could choose to divide the chromatic into, but for historical reasons we've chosen the diatonic/harmonic system. – Todd Wilcox May 1 '18 at 16:54\nI don't think it's a coincidence that the number of possible scales is a power of 2 (12).\nIf you take the chromatic scale and remove any one of the notes, you're left with an ionian mode. If you then remove another note, you get a dorian mode; and so on. This continues until you end up with a single-note scale.\nSo, the reason why the common musical scale is built from the 7-note ionian mode is because that's the smallest mode with distinct chords other than the tonic triad. You can build a heptatonic scale by removing any seven consecutive notes from the chromatic scale.\nIn the case of the major scale, we start with the 7-note ionian mode, and remove the leading tone (that is, the seventh scale degree), creating the tonic triad and the mediant chord.

You have to show them.\nDocumentation is a form of communication. It is how you tell other people what you know. Similarly, collaborative communication platforms like Slack and Hipchat are how you talk to other people. If your team already has strong verbal (written or otherwise) communication skills, then documentation (and possibly Slack/Hipchat) should be used sparingly, if at all. If the people on your team cannot communicate effectively without documentation, then you need to improve their verbal communication skills.\nDevelopers who focus heavily on writing good documentation may not be the most effective communicators. Developers who rely heavily on collaborative communication platforms may not be very skilled at actually communicating. Your job as a manager is to find the right balance. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the number of written words expended documenting the application is less than the number of words spoken in discussions about the application during the same time period.\nFor example, suppose a team of ten programmers takes three months to develop a product. During that time, they spend ten hours per week discussing aspects of the application in a conference room. Let's say each conversation lasts half an hour,"

Whether or not the landlord’s reasoning is valid, he should be required to give your sister adequate notice of any rent increase, and there are limits on how much the increase can be. The amount depends on where she lives, but it can’t be more than 6% a year in New York City. Even if the landlord is allowed to increase the rent based on the cost of the apartment, the increase can’t be more than the percentage limit (or 7.7% this year).

The problem is that when we take him for walks he tends to sniff everyones butt that we pass, male or female. I have tried making him sit before letting him off leash but he still does it. He also likes to roll in dead things and poo. Is this normal? Any suggestions?\nIts not just your dog that is sniffing everyones butt. Dogs use scent to communicate with each other and mark their territory. If you notice the dogs are sniffing each other then they will probably sniff you too. There is nothing you can do to stop him from smelling but there is something you can do to keep him from rolling in dead animals and poop. Use a product called \"Scoot\" at the first sign of him rolling. It stops him in his tracks and prevents him from doing it again for about a week.\nIt is very common for dogs to sniff other dogs butts, especially dogs that don't know each other very well. It is also common for them to sniff people's butts, although less so. A dog will often smell another dogs rear to determine whether or not they are friendly. This behavior is usually only an issue if it happens all of the time, or if it bothers the person whose butt he is sniffing.\nAs for rolling in dead animals or feces, some dogs enjoy rolling, some dogs don't.

Economist Kathryn Edin, of Harvard University, and sociologist Timothy Nelson, of the University of Washington, conducted a thorough review of existing studies and conclude that there is little evidence supporting the idea that welfare and other government support for low-income families encourages women to have children without marrying.\n“In fact, a majority of researchers find no consistent relationship between antipoverty programs and increases in single motherhood,” they write.\nThe authors note that many previous studies focused on the effects of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the federal welfare program that began in 1935 and became the primary form of cash assistance for low-income families in the mid-1960s through the late"

It accounted for the precession of Mercury's orbit, predicted the bending of light by gravity, allowed gravitational time dilation to be measured, and permitted the prediction of black hole spacetime.\nWho discovered general relativity?\nAlbert Einstein developed the theory of general relativity between 1907 and 1915.

Can I simply wait it out or should I take something like Saccharomyces boulardii to help flatten the curve?\nI'm not sure why you think you need to do anything about the high levels of bacteria. They are probably beneficial.\nIt seems like your body is doing just fine with these microorganism.\nAntibiotics are not always the best answer, especially when dealing with viral infections. If you're still feeling bad, see if there's some other underlying cause.\nAntibiotics will destroy all the bacteria in your body. Some bacteria are good for us, while others can be harmful. Our gut has billions of bacteria in it, and our immune system has evolved over millions of years to handle being exposed to these bacteria day in and day out.

In a survey by the Pew Research Center earlier this month, two-thirds of Americans said they got at least some of their news from Facebook – yet only 4% said they had heard about the project.\nAs with many get-tough-on-fake-news solutions, the problem is not the solution. Social media platforms are a critical forum for free expression, and banning disfavoured voices simply embeds them deeper into the public consciousness. Just as we saw in the 1930s, when fascism was on the rise worldwide, limiting speech can have unintended consequences. When the Nazis were silenced, they went underground.\nI don’t think it is so much a matter of “nationalism becoming more prevalent” as it is that nationalists (and other kinds of extremists) exploit new media to spread their message, foment hatred, and recruit followers. The same thing happened with radio broadcasting in the late 1930s and early 1940s. I do think that social media platforms are particularly vulnerable to such manipulation because the users themselves are not paying for access to the platform, but are using it for free. As a result, there is no financial incentive for the platform to discourage or prevent the spread of virulent content. This makes the job of identifying and removing such content all the more difficult.
