Tension headaches are the most common type, with about 90% of adults experiencing these at some point. These headaches involve a dull, constant ache on 1 or both sides of your head. They can feel like a tight band around your head. Avoid bottled water! Bottled water is not only more expensive than tap water, but it also contains chemicals that leach from plastic, and can actually cause dehydration. Stick to filtered tap water in order to stay hydrated. If you don’t have access to filtered tap water, then buy an affordable filter for your home to ensure that you are drinking clean water.\nIn a related finding, researchers found that the greater the decrease in average IQ score between childhood and adulthood, the higher was the probability of psychosis. In addition, they found that the stronger the association between IQ change and schizotypal personality disorder, the greater the risk of subsequent psychotic experience. The authors conclude that their findings support the “developmental neurobiological hypothesis” of schizophrenia, which posits that the disease originates in fetal life or early childhood, when the brain is particularly vulnerable to environmental insult..

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
