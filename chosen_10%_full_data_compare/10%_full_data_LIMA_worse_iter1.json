If you're going through a breakup , you may find yourself trying to replay conversations or moments from your relationship in your mind. The fact is that relationships don't always work out, and you have to accept that if you want to move on. Eat healthy meals, get plenty of sleep, and exercise regularly to take care of yourself.\nShe added: ‘I’m not going to be able to get over this because I loved him so much. It was the best thing that ever happened to me, so I will never get over. I’m still devastated and I feel like my heart has been ripped out.’ She continued: ‘I just wish he had been honest with me and told me how he felt before we got engaged. I would have rather gone through the break-up then than be in this position now. I know I am going to regret not marrying.\nBut what do you say when someone close to you is going through a breakup? Especially when you. makes it clear that they are not interested in talking, let them be. Be there for them later. Sometimes, after processing and venting about their ex, your friend is ready to talk and open up. Listen and let them tell their story. Let them express their emotions without judgment. Everyone processes grief differently. There is no \"right\" way to deal with a breakup.\n“It’s easy to live with someone you have a lot in common with,” says Jesse, “but it’s the little things that count—"

Late April and early May can also be slow, as it's spring break for many schools. The rest of the year is \"summer\" or high season, which is when most people visit Disney World.\nBecause of the weather (it's hot and humid), the crowds are much lower from early June through late August, although this period does include the busiest holiday periods (Memorial Day weekend, Fourth of July, and Labor Day). Outside of these periods, the busiest times are mid-February through mid-April, and the last two weeks of the calendar year. This is especially true around Christmas, New Year's Eve, and the first week of January, when the park attendance spikes due to school vacations."

It's hard to pick a favorite spot, but here are five islands with great snorkeling opportunities:\n1. The Big Island: You can see turtles at almost all the snorkel beaches like Hapuna Beach, Mauna Kea Beach, and Sheraton Keauhou Bay. My personal favorite is Captain Cook's Beach, because the water is calm, and there are always lots of fish and turtles. (Note: There are no lifeguards on this side of the island. So if you are staying at a resort, head for the beach across the street.)\n2. Oahu: Snorkeling at Hanauma Bay is a must-do when visiting Honolulu. It's inside a crater and the water is really calm. You can also see fish and turtles at Duke Kahanamoku Beach (also known as Waikiki Beach), as well as Shark's Cove on the north shore.\n3. Molokai: If you want an adventure, take a boat tour to the coral atoll called Molokini. You can snorkel around the rim and get in the water caves.\n4. Lanai: Take a boat to the small islet of \"Puu Pehe\" (also known as Sweetheart Rock) off the west coast of Lanai.

This is considered polite because it allows them to share what they have with others, and not wasting food is a great social concern in Japan.\n\nThis is so ingrained in Japanese culture that Japan has the word \"omae\" (literally \"self\") for the concept of personal or private possession. When you go to someone's home, you are expected to eat what they have prepared - even if it is something you personally dislike. If you refuse, you are insulting the cook.\nSo asking whether someone has any dietary restrictions would be an insult in Japan."

Bitcoin is still the most dominant form of cryptocurrency, but many people now invest in altcoins because they believe they offer more potential for growth."

Everyone is willing to go above and beyond to get things done, helping each other out and sharing knowledge. Working in an environment with smart people who are excited about what they do is incredibly motivating.\nWorking at a tech giant may sound less glamorous, but it has its advantages too. Unlike a startup, these companies have got budgets for training, conferences and equipment. The teams are bigger so there are more opportunities for specialisation. There’s also the potential for greater job security, as well as better benefits and salaries.\nIn my experience, it’s important to weigh up the pros and cons of both before making a decision."

As such, it adds nothing to the discussion.\nI can tell you with 100% certainty that if the South had won the Civil War, slavery would not have continued indefinitely as it did in the United States. The reason is simple: after being defeated, the Confederacy would not have been able to maintain its independence, and so would have eventually been forced to accept the results of the war. That means Reconstruction would have occurred, and the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments would have been ratified, thereby ending slavery in the United States.\nThe fact that this has become such a contentious issue is bizarre.

        "input": "",
        "output": "\nIt’s common to hear beginning musicians complain that the musical scale is too difficult to learn. Certainly, it is more difficult than it would appear at first glance: seven keys are major and five are minor. In what follows, I will try to explain how this came about.\nThe musical scale, as we know it today, was forged during the baroque period, roughly between 1600 and 1750. The scale of that time had 12 chromatic notes plus two “dead” notes. The two dead notes were B-flat and D-sharp. (These notes have since been brought into the scale by means of a small change in the key signature, reducing the number of sharps or flats in that signature by one.) In the baroque scale, these two notes sounded very different from the other 10. Today they are indistinguishable from them; in fact, they are identical except for their names. That is why the scale has only 12 notes today, instead of 14.\nThe origins of western music can be traced back to the middle ages, around the year 1000. At that time, no such thing as a standard scale existed. Each composer invented his own scale, which could vary widely from one composition to another.\nAs an example, consider the scale used in Gregorian chants, which were sung throughout Western Europe at that time. It consisted of eight tones and was built on a repeating pattern of three tones followed by a semitone, followed again by three tones and so on. For example, starting on C, the pattern would be C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. This creates a sequence of eight different notes. Three examples of this are shown below.\nNotice that the pattern starts with a"

In a study published in Nature Communications, they show how EGFR kinase inhibitors are effective against lung cancer cells with mutated KRAS but not against those without such mutations. The results reveal that these inhibitors could be combined with other treatments to improve their effectiveness. “At present, there is no cure for lung cancer,” said Annaferrer. “Surgery and chemotherapy can help, but the prognosis is usually poor because most tumours have already metastasized by the time they are diagnosed.” According to Annaferrer, the main cause of resistance to treatment is the activation of alternative signalling pathways in the cells. This means that cancer cells find ways to survive despite environmental changes. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers studied both normal and cancerous tissue samples. They found that lung cancer cells […]"

High-end restaurants also have a reputation to maintain and don’t want customers leaving feeling sick after eating too much."

The population was much smaller then, so this means a small share of families were headed by unmarried mothers. In 2014, that figure had risen to 45 percent – a huge increase.\nIn addition, the current poverty rate for single moms with children is more than twice the overall poverty rate (45 percent versus 19 percent) and nearly four times higher than the rate for married-couple families (8 percent).\nWhat does research have to say about whether social welfare policies cause an increase in out-of-wedlock births? Abstinence-only programs don’t work. The evidence suggests they might even increase the likelihood of teen pregnancy.\nWe analyzed 31 studies from 19 countries on the effects of social welfare programs on family formation and found that access to cash assistance, food aid, and Medicaid had little or no effect on women’s decisions to marry — but did reduce the odds of having a child out of wedlock. Other findings include: increasing Supplemental Security Income benefits for children decreases the probability that their mother will give birth as an unwed teenager; increasing the earned income tax credit reduces the probability of early motherhood; and providing TANF recipients with access to comprehensive employment and training services reduced the likelihood that a young mother will have a subsequent birth outside"

However, I think your question still has merit because anode protection can work by allowing corrosion products to form on the surface of the anode instead of on the metal being protected. This is why protective anodes are used in concrete structures where chloride-induced carbonation would lead to spalling. Here is some more information about this technique. But it's important to remember that these techniques only buy time until the structure can be de-salinated or otherwise made dry. $\\endgroup$ – rjpond Jul 17 '18 at 19:58\n$\\begingroup$I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is about engineering rather than chemistry. $\\endgroup$ – orthocresol♦ Aug 2 '18 at 13:29\nSacrificial anodes are regularly used in the maritime industry to prevent the hulls of ships from rusting. Since most of the metals used in shipbuilding have a greater tendency to produce hydrogen when they react with seawater, sacrificial anodes are made from cheaper materials (e.g., zinc) which are consumed instead of the more valuable metals of the hull.

The long answer is that there are a variety of different views on this question, so I think it depends on what you mean by \"we all have this innate need\". Some people do seem to be more philosophical than others, but I don't think that means they are more driven to find the meaning of life.
