For example, when learning about the forces between nucleons, think about why two balls rolling along a pool table will eventually stop, while they'll keep rolling forever on a trampoline. Or think about why a pile driver works: it's pushing down on the tip of the pile driver with much greater force than the tiny amount of force being applied by the nails going into the wood. When you think about what's really happening in terms of the strong force, it's much easier to wrap your head around."

However, they've changed a lot in recent years and now offer many of their products for free or at low cost, while also offering more flexibility in how you use them.\nNintendo is probably the least pro-consumer company on this list. They have a very strict control over what you can and cannot do with their products, and they limit your ability to resell them. They also often release games that are not very user-friendly or have bugs that make them unplayable.\nSony has been both pro- and anti-consumer at different times. They used to be notorious for not allowing you to play used games on their consoles, but they've since backed off on that. They also used to make you pay a fee every time you wanted to buy an online game, but now they've dropped that as well.\nEA is another company that's been criticized for being anti-consumer due to their strict controls over their games and high prices.

        "output": "Instance segmentation is a challenging task. In this blog, we will discuss how to improve instance segmentation AP metrics by leveraging human knowledge for object detection. Come join us on our learning journey!\nObject detection in images is a classic computer vision problem that has been extensively studied over the past few decades. Most modern neural network-based detectors use one or multiple anchors to localize objects. Anchors are often hand-crafted or learned from datasets. For example, the Faster R-CNN model uses Region Proposal Networks (RPN) as its backbone to learn anchors. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module refines and creates new anchors at different levels of abstraction in the feature map hierarchy provided by the ResNet backbone. The Mask R-CNN model introduces the region heads and adds class predictions for each bounding box. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.\nHowever, these methods cannot directly leverage existing knowledge about object instances. For example, a person sitting at a desk may have a laptop, a phone, and a cup of coffee nearby. Object detectors must detect all these objects as separate instances, leading to a high false positive rate. This problem is further exacerbated when there are many objects or when they are small.\nIn this blog, we focus on improving instance segmentation AP metrics by leveraging human knowledge for object detection.\nHuman knowledge provides rich information about object instances such as:\nOften an object's parts are grouped together (e.g., the chair's seat, legs, and back).\nObjects often come in families with similar appearances (e.g., dogs, cats, humans).\nObjects often share common attributes (e.g., color, size, shape).\nThis information can be used to guide the predictor"

        "output": "Ideological thinking is characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs, assumptions, and dogmas that are not supported by facts or evidence. This can lead to inconsistencies in thinking, as people may hold beliefs that contradict each other or are not supported by the available evidence. For example, a person might believe that the government should provide more assistance to those in need, but also believe that individuals are responsible for their own success and should not rely on others.\nInconsistency can also arise when people use different standards for judging different groups of people. For instance, a person might believe that everyone should have equal opportunities to succeed, but only apply this principle to certain groups they identify with. This type of inconsistency can be fueled by ideological thinking, where beliefs and assumptions about certain groups are used to justify discriminatory actions or policies.\nOverall, ideological thinking can create a sense of inconsistency in thinking, as people may hold beliefs that are not supported by facts or evidence, or apply different standards to different groups of people."

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

Diabetes can lead to kidney damage over time, which is what we see with CKD. Insulin is very effective at helping control blood sugar levels. At some point, most individuals with diabetes who develop CKD will require insulin. The decision to initiate insulin therapy can be a difficult one for both the patient and physician. Ultimately, we would like to delay dialysis for as long as possible, and insulin can help us achieve this goal.\nI recommend speaking with your nephrologist about starting insulin. They may recommend an oral medication first. If your A1c is above 8%, then insulin should be considered. Once insulin therapy is started, we can try to use the least amount of insulin needed to control your blood sugar levels. This can usually be achieved with either once or twice daily injections. Insulin is also available as a pump, which may be a good option for some patients. I recommend working closely with your healthcare team to determine if insulin therapy is right for you."

As a result, some politicians have proposed legislation that would affect whether or not pipelines could be built. For example, in 2017, President Trump issued an executive order that expedited the approval process for the construction of pipelines. This was done in part to support the oil industry, which is an important source of jobs and revenue for the US. Others opposed this action because they thought it was bad for the environment."

R*: the rate of formation of stars that have planetary systems\n2. fp: the fraction of those planetary systems with planets that could support life\n3. Ne: the number of planets in the habitable zone of a star\n4. fl: the fraction of habitable planets where life actually emerges\n5. fi: the fraction of planets where life actually develops intelligence\n6. fc: the fraction of planets where developed civilizations appear\n7.

For example, some experts estimate that the error margins for R* and fp could be as high as 100 times their respective values. However, other experts believe that the error margins for these parameters are much smaller, perhaps only a factor of 2 or 3.\nIf we use the upper and lower bounds for each parameter, the result of the Drake equation would look like this:\nN = R* * fp * Ne * fl * fi * fc * L\nUpper bound: N = 100,000\nLower bound: N = 2,000\nTherefore, the estimated number of detectable, communicative civilizations in our galaxy could be anywhere from 2,000 to 100,000."

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

        "output": "The book Upstream is about how to create “a world-shaping movement of small changes.” The author, Dan Heath, makes the case that systems in nature and society are designed by individuals with self-interest. He offers three strategies for overcoming this self-interest: “Create a Surplus, Broaden Our Narrow Focus, and Shape Incentives.” \nFor Visalia Unified School District’s team of Social Workers, the first strategy (Create a Surplus) is of particular relevance. A surplus can be generated by creating programs and services that provide value to participants. For the School Social Workers, they generate a surplus by providing those they work with a sense of hope. The current mental health crisis among our youth requires new ideas from all of us, but especially those working directly with them. This crisis has been characterized as an epidemic with 1 in 6 children and adolescents being affected. Additionally, suicide rates have doubled among teens in the last decade. Clearly, we must implement ideas that generate a surplus to curb the mental health crisis.\nOne such idea is the implementation of more intensive home visiting and in-school supports for those experiencing trauma. For example, peer-to-peer support groups in schools can generate a surplus through the decrease in bullying, increase in student attendance, and improved academic performance. These supports are directly tied to the trauma informed care model. The model focuses on treating the symptoms of untreated trauma. The symptoms include things like aggression, disengagement, substance abuse, and lack of trust. This is a powerful approach where adults listen to students, and student leaders are developed.\nAnother form of generating a surplus is by helping students overcome poverty related risk factors such as lack of food, clean water"

        "output": "Case: The US sanctions were illegal.\nThe sanctions are a violation of the US Constitution. Article I, Section 8 specifies that only Congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. By imposing economic sanctions, President Trump is essentially declaring war against Russia — without Congressional authorization. This is a clear violation of the Constitution."

He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.<br>He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old <br>car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month.<br>Furthermore this percent of loss increases of `0.5` percent <br>Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.<br>Can you help him?<br>How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, <br>and how much money will he have left over?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "<br>Let us consider the amount of money he has at the beginning as x.<br>The price of the old car decreases by 1.5% per month.<br>So, after `n` months, the price of the car will be (1.5/100)^n times the initial price.<br>Similarly, the price of the new car decreases by 0.5% per month.<br>So, after `m` months, the price of the car will be (0.5/100)^m times the initial price.<br>We know that the total money he will have to pay for both the cars is equal to the cost of the old car plus the cost of the new car.<br>So, we can write an equation :<br>x = Total money available<br>1.5^(n)x + 0.5^(m)x = Cost of the old car<br>1.5^(n)x + 0.5^(m)x = Cost of the new car<br>Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get :<br>0.5^(m)x = (Cost of the new car – Cost of the old car)<br>Taking logarithm on both sides, we get :<br>m = log(0.5^(m)x/[1.5^(n)x + 0.5^(m)x])<br>Now, we have two equations in two variables. Solving these equations, we get :<br>n = 6.5<br>m = 7.8<br>So, the man will take 7.8 months to save up enough money to buy the car he wants.<br>He will have $2300 left over with him.<br>"

        "output": "The brand is a form of intellectual property, which is a kind of intangible assets. It can only be achieved after the enterprise puts it into use. The core concept of branding is to make consumers recognize and associate with, so that the brand has a certain degree of emotional recognition and preference.\nIn addition to the obvious tangible advantages, intangible assets such as brands also have a great impact on enterprise value. Especially for high-tech companies, brands are an important basis for maintaining barriers to entry and gaining market recognition and competitiveness.\nSo what are the important points for brand promotion and brand marketing?\nFirst, from the perspective of brand building, it is necessary to clarify the brand’s own positioning and target customers; second, to establish a good reputation and image for the brand, and continuously improve brand awareness; third, to enhance the credibility and reputation of the brand through accurate word-of-mouth publicity; fourth, to strengthen the construction of the brand's website and social media platforms; fifth, to cooperate with various activities to create a good brand image and corporate culture."
