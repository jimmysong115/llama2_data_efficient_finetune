        "output": "Following the trends of the past few years, we can observe that most leading instance segmentation models are built on a Transformer-based architecture. One of the main benefits of using these architectures is their ability to take advantage of large amounts of pre-trained language modeling data. But when it comes to instances, recognizing common objects in images seems — at first glance — to be a more limited task than, say, understanding and generating text. \nTo some degree, this is true. However, the language modeling experience also has some valuable lessons for instance segmentation. In particular, the emphasis on transfer learning and leveraging human knowledge to improve model performance.\nIn this article, I'll explore how leveraging human knowledge can help improve instance segmentation performance. \nThe importance of transfer learning\nA popular approach to building an instance segmentation model is to start with a pre-trained model. The idea is to use a large, pre-trained language model like GPT-2 or OpenAI's CLIP as a basis for your model. \nThis allows you to get access to the vast amount of information contained in the language model's encoder. When you fine-tune the model to instances, you're effectively \"bootstrapping\" the model with additional supervision. This gives the model a head start and allows it to learn faster from your data. \nBecause of this property, transfer learning approaches can lead to much better results compared to training an instance segmentation model from scratch (e.g. using a ResNet-50 backbone).\nHowever, there is a catch. Transfer learning isn't free. And what I mean by that is that the model needs a lot of additional supervision to learn to recognize individual instances. Without adequate supervision, the model will struggle to match up object instances with their corresponding class labels.\nWithout"

        "output": "Ministerial Speech: Innovation – Driving the Australian Economy Forward\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining me today. As Minister of Innovation, I am pleased to be here to deliver a speech outlining the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy.\nInnovation is one of the most important drivers of economic growth and competitiveness in the modern world. It has the power to create new industries, generate new jobs, and raise living standards. In Australia, we have been recognising this for some time, which is why our government has made it a priority to foster an innovative culture throughout the country.\nInnovation can take many forms, from developing new products and services to improving processes and workflows. But regardless of the specifics, innovation always leads to increased efficiency, productivity, and prosperity. And nowhere is this more true than in the Australian economy.\n1. Increased Productivity\nInnovation can increase productivity in a number of ways. New technologies can automate processes, reducing the need for manual labour and freeing up resources. This can lead to cost savings and increased profits for businesses. Additionally, new methods of production can lead to more efficient use of resources, reducing waste and pollution.\nMoreover, innovation can also lead to improved collaboration and communication within companies. By embracing new technologies and processes, businesses can become more agile and responsive to market demands. This can result in faster decision-making and better customer service.\n2. Greater Competitiveness\nInnovation can also help Australian businesses become more competitive on the global stage. By developing new products and services, businesses can gain a competitive advantage over rivals who are stuck in the past. This can lead to increased exports, further boosting the economy and creating new job"

The implementation: In an app for an online fast fashion e-commerce platform, the user uploads a video in which the whole body of the user is within frame and the user turns 360 degree. Using the data from the video, the app reconstructs a 3d avatar which is shaped accurately by the measurements of the user. The avatar has almost the same face and hairstyle as the user. In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs).

Anakin couldn't help but stare, as the figure moved with an air of nobility and grace, like a 1920s British aristocrat.\nThe figure turned and saw Anakin, and smiled. \"Why, hello there,\" he said in a cultured voice. \"I am Lord Vader, a Jedi Master of great renown. But you may call me... Count Dooku.\"\nAnakin was taken aback by the sight of this Jedi Master, who spoke and acted like a proper British gent. He had never met someone like this before, and he couldn't help but be intrigued. \"Pleased to meet you, Count Dooku,\" he said, bowing slightly. \"I am Anakin Skywalker, and this is my master, Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"\nDooku nodded in return, his mask hiding his expression. \"A pleasure to meet you both. I must confess, I am impressed by your skill, Anakin. You are quite talented for one so young.\"\nAnakin blushed slightly, pleased by the compliment. \"Thank you, my lord,\" he replied. \"If you don't mind me asking, what brings you to these parts?\"\nDooku waved a hand dismissively. \"Oh, just traveling from one place to another.

What are the possible performance issues in such a learning program?\nThe concept of cultural values is very subjective as each individual might interpret it differently. For example, while for some honesty might be a valued quality, for others it might be modesty. Hence, there is a possibility that learners may not relate to certain cultural values presented in the video, thereby leading to a lack of engagement and interest in the program. Additionally, the videos themselves might not be of high quality, which can further negatively impact the learning experience. Finally, the learning program might not address the specific needs or interests of the learners, leading to a lack of relevance and therefore, low motivation."

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

This is unlike watching a film, where I need to give my full attention for the full duration. Am I just lazy, or is there something in the structure of a TV show that makes it easier to watch?\n\nAs an experiment, I watched The Shape of Water last night. It's about 2 hours and 10 minutes long. I found myself getting tired about halfway through and wanting to stop, but felt I couldn't because it was already too late into the film.

These digital credentials can include community tax certificates, driver's licenses, passports, and other relevant permits. The wallet is designed to be secure and tamper-resistant, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and use the digital credentials.\nThe blockchain-based platform is used to store and manage the verifiable credentials issued by the system. The platform uses a distributed ledger technology to ensure that all transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable. This also eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or government agencies, reducing transaction costs and improving efficiency.\nThe machine learning algorithm is used to analyze data from the platform and generate insights into user behavior and trends. This helps to identify fraudulent activities, improve the issuance of digital credentials, and provide personalized services to users.\nThe present invention provides a novel solution for issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits using digital credentials. The use of a verifiable credential wallet, blockchain-based platform, and machine learning algorithm ensures that the system is secure, efficient, and transparent. It also provides a convenient and user-friendly way for individuals to manage their digital credentials and access services."
