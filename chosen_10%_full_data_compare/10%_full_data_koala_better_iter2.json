Instaknow-ACE implements the SOA and BPM capabilities in a radically advanced manner, using \"Non-intrusive Model Driven Architecture (n-MDA)\". Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems. An operation that can respond quickly to changing business requirements, automate and empower decision-making, create real time collaboration across the enterprise and the Web, while leveraging existing systems, can now be achieved with minimal resources and investment.\nWhat can be inner working model of this company?",

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",

The study was published July 9 in Nature Nanotechnology. The findings could lead to more effective and less toxic chemotherapies for cancers with high levels of KRAS mutations, which include most pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\nAs they have previously done with other types of cancer, the researchers first labeled gold nanoparticles with antibodies that target specific receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. In this case, the team labeled gold nanoparticles with an antibody against GPR106, a G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed on the surfaces of KRAS-mutant cancer cells but not on normal cells.\nKRAS is a small G protein that plays an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation. Around 25% of all human cancers have mutations in one or more copies of KRAS, making it one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. The majority of KRAS mutations affect the G12/13 domain, which controls reorganization of the cell's cytoskeleton and modulation of signaling pathways. Mutations in KRAS are associated with poor outcomes for patients, even if they receive chemotherapy, according to the National Cancer Institute.\nIn the latest study, when the researchers injected mice with KRAS-mutant pancreatic tumor cells, they found that the gold nanoparticles accumulated at the tumor site due to"

It has encouraged me to step outside my comfort zone and to take risks in order to create something unique and meaningful.\nOverall, photography has been an incredibly powerful tool for inspiration and self-expression. It has allowed me to connect with others, to discover new things, and to grow as a person."

This path is somewhat non-obvious in that you need to have the technical depth to understand production issues, but also need to have good leadership skills to manage people.  Most engineers do not take this route because they are more interested in being individual contributors rather than managers.\nAn atypical path would be to go into consulting.  Consultants are often tasked with defining new processes for production facilities, so you will gain valuable experience in understanding different production techniques.  You may also be exposed to different industries which may open up other opportunities."

Living in this beautiful oasis has been a dream for me and my family.   This city has many wonderful qualities that make it attractive to tourists and college students alike.  The first quality I noticed about Flagstaff was the beauty of the landscape.  With the San Francisco Peaks providing a stunning backdrop, every drive around town is scenic.  I love driving up Humphreys Peak for an astounding view of the town below.  I also enjoy going on hikes in the nearby Coconino National Forest.  It's always exciting to discover new places to explore.  Another great part of Flagstaff is how safe it is.  With a low crime rate and friendly people, this place feels like home.  Everyone here is so kind and easy going, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.  Although there aren't many big cities, there are still lots of things to do.  There are museums, restaurants, shops, and parks galore.  My favorite places are the Lowell Observatory, the Museum of Northern Arizona, and the Pulliam Airport.  One personal anecdote about living in Flagstaff is walking down Milton Road with my dog after a snow storm.  I loved seeing all the tracks our dog made in the fresh snow.  This is just one of the many memories I have of living in Flagstaff."

In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

So, the question is, how many glass panes are optimal to maximize the energy efficiency while keeping the cost under a certain limit? To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors:\n1. The climate zone - the amount of heat loss or gain through windows depends on the climate zone.\n2. The thickness of each pane of glass - thicker glass provides better insulation, but it also increases the cost.\n3. The U-factor of the window - the lower the U-factor, the better the window is at preventing heat loss or gain.\n4. The cost of the windows - as the number of panes increases, the cost of the windows also increases.\nTo find the optimal number of glass panes, we need to balance the energy savings with the cost of the windows. We can use a linear programming approach to solve this problem. Let's assume that we have two variables, N and C, representing the number of glass panes and the cost of the windows, respectively. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (measured in terms of the U-factor) subject to a limit on the cost of the windows. The constraints are:\n1. The maximum number of glass panes is 3.\n2. The cost of the windows cannot exceed a certain limit, say Cmax.\nThe linear programming problem can be written as follows:\nMaximize U-factor Subject to Constraints:\nN ≤ 3\nC ≤ Cmax\ns.t. U-factor ≤ f(N, C)\nwhere f(N, C) is a function that takes into account the U-factor of the window as a function of the number of glass panes and the cost of"

I've been thinking about using some of the older giants (like frost and fire) as the final bosses for a couple of the early adventures, and I'm wondering what sort of mechanical implications that would entail. For instance, say my players managed to find and defeat a frost giant in its lair.

How do creatures like this work when they're the final boss of an adventure?\nDungeons &amp; Dragons: 5th Edition Monster Manual describes Frost Giants as having only a +1 bonus to Armor Class and not being immune to non-magical weapons. Since you are playing 5e I assume you are aware of the Monster Manual 2, which does list Frost Giants as having the immunity to non-magical weapons property. However, even if they had it listed in the basic D&amp;D 5e Monster Manual I wouldn't let them use non-magical weapons against a Frost Giant. Frost Giants are tough enough without making them easier to kill. The fact that Frost Giants have a high Constitution score means they are slow to kill already.
