Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

The cinematography in the film helps to create a sense of tension, release, and emotion that accompanies the characters’ journey.\nThe opening shots of the film are a bustling street in Boston, where we see Keating riding his bike towards the camera. This establishes a sense of freedom and energy that will become a recurring motif throughout the film. As Keating enters the school, the camera pans up to reveal the towering buildings, creating a feeling of confinement and restriction. This will be contrasted with the openness of nature, which will be used as a metaphor for freedom and creativity.\nThroughout the film, there are numerous scenes of Keating leading his students outside to explore the natural world around them. The camera often maintains a wide angle, allowing us to take in the beauty of the landscape and the joy of discovery. These shots are often intercut with close-ups of the students’ faces, revealing their wonder and excitement.\nAs the film progresses, the cinematography becomes more dramatic, reflecting the increasing tension between Keating and the school administration. There are several scenes of Keating chalking poems on the blackboard, which are shot from low angles to convey a sense of power and authority. Similarly, when Keating stands up to the administration, the camera often shoots him from below, making him look larger and more intimidating.\nThe final scene of the film is perhaps the most iconic and well-known. As Keating delivers his famous “carpe diem” speech, the camera pans up from the students to the sky, where we see the words “O Captain! My Captain!” project"

She also wants to find out if improving sleep by reducing light exposure can improve health outcomes.\nIn addition to determining how light exposure affects the participants' health, the study will explore how socioeconomic status and neighborhood conditions play a role in how much light people are exposed to at night.\nThe study's participants include a mix of college students, firefighters, shift workers, parents and other individuals who do not have consistent sleep schedules. In contrast to previous studies that typically recruited older adults, Zee wanted to include younger people since hormones and physiology change with age and can impact how light exposure affects health.\nErin Hager, a 32-year old participant in the study, started the experiment last month. She has Type 1 diabetes, which requires her to monitor her blood sugar levels throughout the day and night. Her doctor recently raised her blood sugar medicine dosage, but she hasn't yet seen if the new regimen is helping with her numbers. As part of the study, Hager agreed to wear an accelerometer on"

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

        "input": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
