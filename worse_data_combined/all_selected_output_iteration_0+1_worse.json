There are a multitude of dogs and cats out there that can't positively be identified as any one (or even two, or three!) breeds due to interbreeding.\nThese questions are also not really searchable, making them of incredibly limited value for our site.\nQuestions on pets that are less subject to cross breeding, such as reptiles or birds, would probably be on topic for biology given their current acceptance and use of their species-identification tag, so making them on-topic here seems redundant and unnecessary (especially given the problems with identifying dog or cats breeds).\nAnyone looking for help in identifying their pet should be encouraged to ask in The Litter Box, however.",

Just for an example of what kind of difference three years in age can do. It is the same dog in both of pictures below. Identifying his breed is not difficult if you happen to know what other dogs of that same breed typically look like.\n\nAlso these above pictures are of the best kind for identifying purposes, I say.\nMy point is; let's assume this was some exotic animal that has even greater level of variation in how it looks in different ages. Add to that the (often) lesser picture quality. The identifying task quickly becomes very challenging and a many such question will be left unanswered in Pets SE."

        "input": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Ramen is an iconic instant meal. If you've got to have it now -- as in, right now -- microwaving ramen is a snap. You can learn to cook your noodles quickly and efficiently in the microwave, and a couple neat ways to fancy-up your noodles for a serious meal. See Step 1 to learn more about making ramen in the microwave.\n1. Some Ramen enthusiasts like to break up the noodles while the bag is still sealed, making shorter soup-like noodles that are easier to eat with a spoon, while others choose to leave the noodles in a block to slurp traditional-style. It's up to you how you want to eat them.\n2. Typically, you'll need somewhere between 1 and 2 cups of water, depending on the size of the bowl you're using and the amount of broth you want in the soup.\n\nTo prevent splattering in the microwave, it's also a good idea to cover with a lid, or with a simple piece of paper towel to avoid making a mess. The noodles will sometimes float in the bowl, but that's nothing to worry about. They'll cook just fine.\nMake sure your bowl is safe to microwave for several minutes. Plastic containers and styrofoam are controversial to some consumers, because of concerns about BPA and other toxins being leeched into the food during microwaving.\n3. Place your noodles in the microwave, set the timer, and start cooking. The exact cooking time may vary, since microwaves all behave somewhat differently.\nTo help the noodles cook evenly, and check to make sure they're not over-stewing (which can result in over-done noodles without any bite), stop the microwave about half-way through the cooking time and stir them with a fork. If you want the noodles to remain in a brick, just press on them a little, or flip the brick over to keep it whole.\n4. Don't take them out right away! Many are the burned tongues of the over-anxious ramen eater. Just let it sit for three minutes in the closed microwave, and you'll keep your fingers and your mouth safe, letting them finish in peace and cool down to a less-than-nuclear temperature.\nIf you must take the noodles out immediately use oven mitts or some other heat protection and be careful. Fortunately, this is a perfect time to add the flavor packet, while the water's nice and hot.\n5. Stir noodles with a spoon or fork until flavoring dissolves, then pour your cooked Ramen into another bowl, if you want, and commence the deliciousness.\nAlternatively, some Ramen eaters like to add the flavoring before the noodles cook. This is usually easier if you're cooking them over the stove, though it's still possible in the microwave. If you like the flavor to cook with the noodles some (it's a good way to get the noodles more tasty), put the noodles and the flavoring packet in the bowl first, then add the water on top to try to dissolve it some.\n6. Another easy way to make ramen in the microwave is to boil water separately and add it to the noodles, letting them steep. If you like your noodles slightly more firm, this is an excellent way to cook them in the microwave.\nDepending on how much broth you want, anywhere between 1 and 1/3 cup and 2 cups is fine. Less will boil faster, but you want to make sure you have enough to make as much broth as you want.\n7. Because of the way microwaves agitate water atoms, you won't see the water boiling consistently and steaming heavily like you will when you boil water on the stove. Sometimes, it hardly looks hot at all. Aim for a few runs of 2 or 3 minutes through the microwave, stirring quickly in between.\nWhen you're confident the water is hot, pull it out carefully with gloves or an oven mit.\n8. While the water is microwaving, remove the noodles from the package and put them in a separate bowl. You can add the seasoning packet now if you want to, or save it until after the noodles cook some.\n9. When you've got your water hot, pour it over the noodles, cover the bowl with a paper towel, plate, or lid, and let the noodles sit for between 3 and 5 minutes, until the noodles are soft and delicious. Then enjoy!\nThe instructions on the Cup 'O Noodles or Instant Lunch are somewhat vague in regard to the microwave. While the jury's somewhat silent on how dangerous it really is to microwave Styrofoam, it's probably better to heat the water separately and add it to the cup afterward, rather than risking making melted plastic for lunch. Yuck.\n10. Cast off the oppression of the flavor packet! The first rule of Ramen club? Let no one tell you how to eat your Ramen noodles. Instead of tossing in that little package of meat-flavoring, cook up the noodles and flavor the soup yourself. With some basic condiments you can get for cheap at most grocery stores, you can customize your Ramen into a delicious restaurant-quality meal. Try flavoring your broth with any combination of the following ingredients, after you remove it from the microwave:\n\nmiso paste\nHoisin sauce\nrice vinegar\nlemon/lime juice\nSriracha or red chili paste\nsoy sauce\nhoney\ngreen onions\nbasil\n11. Adding a bit of spinach, fresh chopped Thai basil leaves, or other vegetables to your Ramen can up the flavor and the health content. It's a simple way to hot-rod your Ramen.\n\n\n, consider adding celery, finely chopped carrot, garlic, or onions to the soup. Frozen peas work perfectly to add texture, as well as any other pre-cooked frozen vegetable you've got in the freezer.\n\n, add greens, or top with chopped herbs of any kind. Basil and cilantro are especially delicious, but why not toss in some rosemary and a tablespoon of half-and-half to chicken-flavored ramen? It's a savory treat that smells like Thanksgiving and changes the dish completely.\n12. A common addition to Ramen is the incredible edible itself, the egg. While it's somewhat difficult to do the egg-drop method of cooking eggs in the broth itself, you can still use the microwave to cook an egg right in the broth, or simply chop hard-boiled eggs and put them on top.\nIf you want to crack an egg into the soup to add density and flavor, remove the noodles after cooking them and crack the egg in. Stir it vigorously with a fork or a chopstick, and return to the microwave for another minute or so. The hot water should temper the egg itself, but you can return it briefly to make sure.\n13. Toss out the flavor packet and make your own Thai-style peanut noodles from a package of Ramen, all with stuff you've probably already got in your kitchen.\n\nIn a bowl, mix 1 heaping tablespoon of salty peanut butter, preferably an all-natural variety. TO that, mix in a sprinkling of brown sugar, a teaspoon of soy sauce, and Sriracha or hot sauce to taste. If you've got any ginger, it's also good to add in, or grate.\nWhen you take the noodles out of the microwave, pour off most of the hot water, leaving some to mix into the sauce. Pour the noodles into the bowl with the sauce and stir them around vigorously. Top with chopped cilantro and carrot. It's delicious.\n"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Recently, the Guardian reported a grim story about a pupil in an elementary public school in the city of Milan, Italy. At lunchtime, the school principal took the pupil from the cafeteria and forced her to eat her lunch in the classroom, alone and away from her mates. Why? Because she had been caught red-handed. She had brought to school a homemade sandwich instead of relying on the daily lunch served by Milan’s public school system.\nYou can bet this has nothing to do with food safety, and everything to do with browbeating and brainwashing children into deference to authority. Authority being the state, of which teachers and school administrators are a proxy.\nSo what they are trying to do — and they’ve been at it ever since compulsory public schooling systems were created by states in the last two centuries — is mold children’s minds while they are malleable and defenseless. In other words, compulsory “education” is a heartless institution enslaving innocent children in factories which churn out obedient servants of the state. Lobotomy is a better word to describe this.\nBut sitting together, eating safe, organic food is just a fig leaf. Sitting or standing or marching like ants when they are told, and eating when and what they are told, unthinkingly obeying the orders is what compulsory “education” is all about. That’s what all public school systems were created for in the first place, and that’s also the reason attending classes was made compulsory. Compulsory, “free” education is a tool of the state, perhaps its most important. It’s through education that the state first asserts its control and authority on a person’s life. Real communities can only be created through freedom of association. Thus compulsory education is a hindrance to true, meaningful communities.\nEven if we admit that compulsory “education” exists to give younger ones the tools they need to face their future life, even if we take this institution at face value, most of what is taught is useless for most people. We spend many years of our lives studying things we never need in the first place. And if it were not for the vast accreditation system that regulates access to work, we would scarcely need schools at all.\nLike everything that comes from the state, compulsory “education” is against freedom of choice. There is no freedom when choices range from A to A. And there is no “right to education”. Whether to educate oneself or one’s children, and on what conditions, should be up to everyone to decide on their own. But there is no such freedom when the state is the master. Parents have to surrender their children, period. Claiming that compulsory “education” is a right, the state makes a mockery of child’s and parent’s rights. It is mass enslavement of the weakest and most vulnerable.\nCompulsory schools are nothing but the Western, secular version of Islamic madrasas, and the state is the modern despotic, all-pervading god. The state is the worst of all religions. But like all institutional religions, the state is doomed. Increasingly, there are alternatives. Home-schooling and unschooling come to mind. And people are starting to see through the charade. Just like attendance of religious mass dwindled considerably in the last century, attendance to that secular mass which is the state school will be seen more and more inconsistent with personal freedom."

Romney, when asked last week about the gender gap, twice said he wished his wife could take the question. \n  \n “My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me,” Romney told newspaper editors, “and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy.” \n  \n Note to candidate: Women aren’t a foreign country.

He’d come home and” — here Romney makes the sound of a building blowing up — “everything would just explode again.” \n  \n Somehow I doubt that Ann Romney, circa 1982, having finally managed to get her five boys under control, was all that happy about their father coming home only to “get them all riled up again.” Somehow I doubt that beleaguered moms, circa 2012, listen to her story and think, “Oh, Mitt is so much more fun than I thought.” Rather, I suspect, they wonder whether he should have been doing more to lend a hand. \n  \n Indeed, the video offers an unintentional glimpse of Ann’s own frustrations. “It was hard to maneuver,” Ann notes. “I could do okay when I had the two. Three, not so bad. Four, it got to be a little much.” On the campaign trail with her husband, Ann often talks about the old days when she would be at home dealing with her rambunctious brood and Mitt would call from the road. “His consoling words were always the same: Ann, your job is more important than mine.” \n  \n This story is supposed to buttress Mitt’s bona fides as a supportive husband, and Ann is, no doubt, a more tolerant spouse than I am. But every time I hear that patronizing line, I imagine responding, “Great.

Same with age, with 63 percent of female voters 18 to 44 backing Obama, compared to 54 percent of those 45 and older. \n  \n How many of these younger and/or better-educated women are going to identify with Ann Romney’s father-knows-best description of life in chez Romney? I understand that the candidate badly needs humanizing but, especially for general-election purposes, it would be more powerful to combine the family story with examples, assuming they exist, about Workplace Mitt promoting women or adopting family-friendly policies. \n  \n Even as Mitt was playing a bit role in his wife’s video, Obama was hosting a “White House Forum on Women and the Economy.” In an unstated yet unavoidable contrast with stay-at-home mother Ann Romney, Obama described his wife as “the woman who once advised me at the law firm in Chicago where we met” and related how Michelle Obama, after their daughters were born, “gave it her all to balance raising a family and pursuing a career.” \n  \n Obama and Romney come from different backgrounds and generations, and their experience of gender roles is inevitably different as well; if Obama connects better with younger, working women, that’s no surprise. And Romney is not alone in performing poorly with women voters. The GOP has suffered from a gender gap in every presidential election since 1980. \n  \n So Romney can lose the women’s vote and still win, but not if the gap remains this big.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Call of Duty Ghosts introduces several new game modes, variations to the rank system and introduces the ability to create your own soldier. Even if you have not played a Call of Duty game before, you can easily jump in and learn the core mechanics of the game. Once you have an understanding of the overwhelming amount of features and setup you will be able to start playing the game with others online.\n1. Customize your squad member and your loadout.: You will be able to unlock up to ten squad members who are allowed six loadout sets in the Create A Soldier menu which can be found when choosing \"Online\" or \"Xbox Live\" from the main \"Multiplayer\" menu. You will only be able to choose from a small selection of weapons and attributes when you first begin playing. When you complete a match you will earn experience points and rank up. Advancing in rank will gain access to more loadouts, weapons, appearance customization and earn you squad points. Squad points are currency used to primarily unlock guns, gun attachments and to unlock perks early.\n\nYou can share squad points with other squad members, however points that are spent to unlock weapons, attachments or perks will only be unlocked for that squad member and cannot be traded.\nAppearance unlocks are entirely cosmetic and do not affect the gameplay, but allows you to personalize your squad member’s look for others to see.\n2. Create a loadout for your squad member.: You will start with basic loadout configurations for sniper rifles, shotguns and automatic rifles. Each loadout allows you to equip a primary and secondary weapon, attachments for both weapons, a lethal accessory, a tactical accessory, a set of perks and a strike package. The more effective your load out is, the more experience you will be able to gain that will allow you to unlock more weapons. You will not be able to change what each loadout has equipped in-game.\n\nA secondary weapon can come in handy if you run out of ammunition in the middle of gunfire which allows you to fight back.\nBoth your primary and secondary weapons can be equipped with attachments such as scopes and additional magazine clips. These also cost squad points.\nYou can also equip a tactical accessory and a lethal accessory which are handheld weapons or benefits such as grenades. If you do not equip a tactical or lethal accessory, you are granted additional perks.\nPerks allow you to utilize specific attributes that make specific actions quicker and more effective. Perks can cost between one to four points and you can use a total of eight points.\n3. Choose your strike package to map your killstreak rewards.: Strike packages determine the killstreaks that you earn. Killstreaks are earned by consecutively killing opponents. There are three types you can equip.\n\nThe assault package rewards lethal killstreaks after three kills in a row without dying.\nThe support package is less effective but is beneficial to the team and does not reset upon death.\nThe specialist package simply rewards additional perks.\n4. Study the maps.: There are fourteen multiplayer maps, which does not include purchasable Downloadable Content (DLC) maps. Each map is designed specifically that will emphasize high action or high defense in certain areas. Learning about each area will give a tactical advantage on where to take cover and to find the best use for your loadouts.\nSome maps also feature environmental events that can interfere with combat, such as water and earthquakes.\n5. Connect to the online servers.: If you feel you are ready to play online, you can start the multiplayer mode from the main menu. Choose “Multiplayer” from the main menu. Choose “Online” or “Xbox Live” depending on your game system to play over the internet. To start looking for a match to join, choose “Find Match.”\nAn online subscription is required for Xbox 360, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 game consoles to play online.\n6. Set the difficulty of multiplayer.: You will find three categories that change the core mechanics.\n\nStandard mode contains all the regular multiplayer modes to play online. This is the best method to play multiplayer if this is your first time playing.\nHardcore mode is designed to be more unforgiving by granting less health to players, limiting Heads Up Display (HUD) markers by not highlighting team members, disabling the mini-map and allowing friendly fire which makes for a more realistic scenarios of ground warfare. Playing on hardcore mode on certain match types allows for more squad points, but involves a higher risk.\nClan VS. Clan requires you to join a clan before you can use this mode. Joining a clan will put you in a dedicated team of players which will allow you to play against other clans.\n7. Find a game mode to play.: You have several choices of game types to play on. Most game types involve team play.\n\nThere are several returning game modes seen in previous Call of Duty titles such as Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All and Kill Confirmed. These traditional game modes allow for a better understanding of the rules for the game and are most popular among players.\nThere are new game modes introduced to the Call of Duty series such as Cranked and Blitz. These game modes are variations on older game modes and make for a nice change of pace, however are generally tougher to learn the rules of the game.\n8. Work with your team.: Proper communication is key for playing well on team modes which requires you to be able to talk with others using a headset or microphone. Be sure to plug one in before starting a game.\n\nPlay the game with friends online or bring in a friend via split screen on consoles and work with each other.\nFree-for-All does not feature team-based play.\n9. Play with a style that works best for you.: The more you play, the more squad points that you earn. Try creating different load outs that let you create unique soldiers. Each loadout has its strengths and weaknesses which are determined by a weapon’s range, rate of fire and accuracy. Change to a different loadout that would work against specific enemy players.\nYou can change your loadout during a game. While you are dead you can bring up your “Options” menu by pressing the Start, Option or Menu button on your controller or the Esc key on the PC version then choose “Change Loadout” and select from your preset loadouts.\n10. Read and understand the markers on the mini-map.: In the corner of the screen, the mini-map will show locations that indicate the positions of other players as well as provide a tactical view of the map you are playing on. The location of enemy players will change based on the sights of your team if they are able to see opposing players. This can be useful to flank other players by approaching them from a different path.\n\nIn tactical game modes, it will also show the location of domination points, flags or other targets that are important to the game mode.\nBy taking advantage of the Sat COMs perk, you can instantly reveal the location of opposing players within a certain range. However the enemy team can also make use of perks such as the Wiretap to hijack your Sat COMs to work in their favor.\n11. Avoid excessively sprinting around the map.: While it is useful to cover ground as quickly as possible, it does reduce your ability to ready a shot or melee attack an opposing player, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Run in short spurts and avoid running around corners.\n12. Look for opportunities to take cover.: Line up to the sides of a wall or behind a barrier to avoid being left in the open as this makes it easy for other players to target you, especially those on higher ground.\n13. Avoid staying in the same spot.: This is commonly referred to as camping. It is possible to line up shots easily by sitting in one spot and waiting for unsuspecting players, especially for players using sniper rifles. Players will be alerted to your position once they are killed in one of several ways, for example a downed player will witness their Killcam after their death which shows how they were killed by another player. Be prepared to move to a new location. If playing in team games, stay with your team as close as you can.\n14. Spend squad points wisely.: Choose to unlock perks and equipment that works with one of your loadout sets. Squad points are earned universally but can only be spent on one squad member.\n15. Invest your time in playing.: The more you play, the more loadouts, perks and other equipment you will be able to unlock. Time and skill are two things that counterbalance each other when it comes to unlocking more abilities.\n\nYou can earn killstreaks faster by obtaining and completing field orders. Field orders are given by obtaining a briefcase dropped by a downed player. You are then given a challenge to complete a specific task that involves defeating other players, without dying,  to earn a killstreak quickly.\nYou are limited to how much XP you earn when playing matches offline.\nYou can rank your squad member up to level 60. This rank level is known as a “Prestige” rank. Unlike in previous Call of Duty games, you keep all of your unlocks and upgrades and you unlock an emblem that simply shows your dedication for playing the game.\n16. Play the campaign.: If you have never played a Call of Duty game before or have never played a shooter before, this will be the best place to start. You can choose “Campaign” from the main menu. You will be given live tutorials while playing the game. The campaign does not give the same experience of playing against a live opponent and does not have any multiplayer capabilities, but you will see the difference once you are able to understand how the controls work.\nYou can change the difficulty of the campaign before you play. You won’t need to complete the campaign in order to prepare yourself, but it will at least provide the basics on how the game plays overall.\n17. Play Extinction Mode.: If you want to play team based games, Extinction mode is a survival mini game that can be played with three other players. Choose “Extinction” from the main menu. You can choose to play online by choosing “Online” or “Xbox Live.” You can also play with a friend in split-screen multiplayer by choosing “Local Play.” Work with others and communicate with team members to defeat hordes of enemies.\n18. Master the controls.: Each Call of Duty game plays similar to one another, but will feature a few changes to make it easier to play the game compared to previous iterations.\n\nIf you have played a Call of Duty game before, you can easily understand the basics of movement, how to run, aim down your sights and activating streak rewards.\nIf there are actions you would feel more comfortable with a different button or if you want to adjust your turning speed, you can adjust these under the “Control Options” in the “Options” menu.\nThere are a few changes to how the game plays, such as the dolphin-dive move from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, now known as the run and slide. Initiate a sprint then press the crouch button to slide on your knees. If you press and hold the crouch button you will slide until you are lying down into the prone position. You can also lean around corners by standing toward a corner. Once you see an arrow appear near your aiming reticle, you can hold the aim button to lean in the direction the arrow was pointing.\n19. Play a private match.: Private matches allow you to play against computer controlled opponents or “bots” that simulate playing against live opponents. You can also play the game with a friend with up to two players in split screen on consoles.\nUse private matches as an opportunity to see how unlocked weapons work. See how each weapon can be the most effective for you before trying to use them against live opponents.\n"

        "instruction": "Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what are relevant dimensions influencing the skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable?",
        "input": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

They were able to do Q1 on their own, they were able to independently understand ranges in python, and how to iterate over them, and create lists with ranges. What they couldn't seem to understand, is that basically copying and pasting the code from Q1 into the for loop would do exactly what they asked. \n\nI tried to present analogous scenarios to give hints, heck tie it to real life (\"you know how to make an omelette, what do you need to do to make 10?\").  They seemed to \"get\" these other things, but when it came to looking at code and trying to apply the same logic, they just straight up had no idea what to do. \n\nAfter a long time they were not able to grasp the problem, and I didn't feel comfortable literally just telling them the answer.  They eventually talked to another person who gave them a solution (not what they used) and that helped them finish their own independent solution that was 99% of the way there. After the class after the homework was due, they noted how they essentially \"face palmed\" after the professor explained the expected solution (basically copy paste Q1, as I described).\n\nI think part of the issue is that they have yet to cover functions, which would make it a whole lot easier: abstract away the Q1 part of the question, and thus make it easier for them to make that leap.

        "instruction": "Could you outline 16 practical steps to achieve tell your girlfriend that you love her?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Telling your girlfriend that you love her can be one of the most nerve-racking experiences you’ve had in a relationship. You’ll be tempted to overthink it, make crazy and expensive plans, or even tell her in a subtle way that might not come across the way you want it to. Instead, you should be direct and honest, trust your feelings, and pick an appropriate place to tell her. After all, if she feels the same way, then you don’t need an elaborate plan and you won’t need to find the perfect moment.\n1. Time your moment based on how long you’ve been in the relationship.: One of the biggest questions people have is when (how long into the relationship) they should tell their significant other that they love them. This, though, varies from men to women. One study has noted that men take 88 days to tell their girlfriends that they love them, while women take significantly longer. As a result of this, you need to make sure that you’re not rushing the relationship:\n\nMake sure she’s sent signals to you that she feels the same, even if she hasn’t told you that she loves you.\nDon’t tell her you love her during the first couple of weeks of dating. This is far too soon, and inappropriate. While there may be some couples who are sure of their love so early on, chances are, it’s not you.\nIf it feels too early, it probably is too early to tell her you love her. Wait a bit longer. If she feels the same way, it can’t hurt to wait a little bit.\n2. Tell her when you feel the relationship is solid, you are connected, and you want to move to the next level.: Perhaps the best time to tell her you love her is when you feel comfortable in your relationship and want to move it to the next level. There is no specific timeline on this, and it varies from relationship to relationship, so you need to gauge your own relationship and your comfort level before telling her you love her.\n3. Wait for the appropriate (specific) moment.: Telling her that you love her is not something you want to rush. You need to wait for an appropriate moment in which you’ll be able to express yourself and she’ll be able to respond. While you want to wait for an appropriate moment, consider:\n\nThat there is no “perfect” moment. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, you might wait forever.\nDon’t tell her when her complete attention is not on you.\nDon’t tell her when you’re in the process of coming into contact with other people.\nConsider a natural pause in the conversation after she’s said something sweet to you. This way, your admission of love will be a reciprocation of her own feelings.\n4. Wait until the two of you are alone.: Letting her know that you love her should be something you tell her when you’re alone. This doesn’t mean that you have to be completely isolated from everyone when you tell her, but you certainly want to have at least a low level of intimacy between the two. Consider:\n\nNever tell her in front of a group of friends.\nDon’t tell her when you are in front of your or her family.\nGenerally, the less people the better. If you’re alone talking in a crowd, that’s okay. But if you’re the center of attention in the crowd, that might be a bit awkward for one or both of you.\n5. Let it be natural.: If at all possible, you should let her know about how you feel in a natural way. While you’re going to probably think about doing it ahead of time, try not to script it out word for word and time it to the exact minute. It will come across as more sincere if it seems natural.\n6. Make sure you are sober and alert.: The best time to say “I love you” is when you’re sober and alert. There are a number of reasons for this. If you’re not sober and alert, you might botch the delivery. If you’re drunk or tired, your girlfriend might question your motives or think that you don’t really mean what you’re saying.\n\nDon’t be drunk and say “I love you.” Of course, a glass of wine or a beer should be alright (if you’re of age).\nDon’t say “I love you” after you’ve been partying.\nThe more alert you are, the chances are the better you’ll be able to convey your true feelings.\n7. Accompany it with a gift.: Some men prefer to give their girlfriend a gift, present it, and then tell their lady how much she means to him. This is certainly an acceptable way of conveying your love. However, consider:\n\nInexpensive thoughtful gifts that are homemade or represent something in your relationship.\nA necklace or bracelet (if you know she’s been interested in something like this).\nIt might come off as contrived.\nDon’t make your gift too grandiose, because it could seem like you are trying to buy her.\nTry not to make a spectacle out of presenting the gift, this could be embarrassing.\nOnly you know your relationship dynamic, so use your best judgement based on both of your comfort levels and expectations.\n8. Trust your gut.: Telling your girlfriend you love her is something you don’t want to overthink. If you overthink it, it might come off awkward or contrived. Instead, trust your feelings and your intuition. If it feels like the right moment to tell her you love her, then do it.\n9. Invite her to a romantic dinner.: A romantic dinner is a wonderful place to tell your girlfriend that you love her. It’ll set the atmosphere, give you both time to talk and enjoy each other’s company, and give you the opportunity to tell her.\n\nA nice restaurant that you both enjoy will work great.\nConsider a home cooked meal.\nIf cooking at home, try to set the meal apart from everyday meals you might already enjoy together. If appropriate, light a candle and put on some lite music.\n10. Invite her on a picnic.: Picnics are a nice of way of spending time together with an atmosphere that suggests intimacy but is not too suggestive. Chances are, you’ll both enjoy the picnic, and use it as a time to talk and bond more than you have already. It might create the perfect opportunity to give her your news.\n11. Tell her when you’re engaged in light intimacy at one of your homes.: Perhaps you want to let her know in the heat of the moment – when you’re kissing or making out. This works for some people, but there are some potential pitfalls you need to be careful about.\n\nDon’t expect sex. She could think that you are saying it in order to butter her up for sex.\nDon’t tell her during sex. This could come off as insincere.\nDon’t tell her immediately after sex. Instead, wait a few hours at minimum, or even a couple of days.\nMake sure it comes out naturally, and not as some grand sexual plan for the evening.\n12. Avoid telling her at sports events, parties, or movies.: There are a number of reasons why you should avoid entertainment venues for this sort of thing. Most importantly, her attention won’t be on you. But there are other reasons as well:\n\nYou both might be under the scrutiny of others, which could be awkward.\nIf she’s a private person, she might be mad that you shared such a big thing with the whole world.\nOnly you know your relationship and your significant other, so use your best judgement.\n13. Consider a grandiose moment, if you think it’s appropriate.: If you’re both over-the-top, out-going, and flamboyant personalities, then maybe you can consider a grandiose moment to tell her you love her. While this is not recommended for most people, it might be right for you – but ultimately, only you know your relationship and your significant other. If you are the type of person who wants to do this, consider:\n\nHiring a plane trailing a sign “I love you <name>” over a sporting event or some other event where you and your girlfriend will be outside.\nSending her dozens of roses with a card that says I love you. If you want to go really over the top, you can send this to her work. It might be inappropriate, though.\nThere are many other over-the-top ways of conveying your love, just make sure you think it’s right for your relationship.\n14. Tell her directly, at the right time and the right place.: If you think it’s the right time and place, just tell her directly, “I love you.” This is extremely direct, but it’s simple and it will convey what you are feeling. Of course there are a few ways to slightly soften this direct approach:\n\nSay something like “I have a confession to make…” then “I love you.”\nAsk her for her hand, and tell her you love her.\nLead into a conversation about how you see the rest of your life, and then tell her you love her.\n15. Let her know indirectly.: You can tell her you love her in an indirect approach, if you feel more comfortable doing so. However, be warned. While this might alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for you, it might take some of the magic out of the moment. If you do go with the indirect approach, consider:\n\nSpelling “I love you” on a mirror or another surface.\nSending her flowers with a card that says “I love you.”\nWrite her a “love letter” and snail mail it to her.\nUnderstand that an indirect approach could be construed as a grandiose admission of love, too.\n16. Communicate your love nonverbally.: Sharing your love in a nonverbal way is something many people do. There are pros and cons to this approach. First, a nonverbal signal of love might mean more than just mere words. However, it could also lack the force and emotion of a direct verbal approach. If you’re going to go nonverbal, consider:\n\nLooking into her eyes at the right moment. If you have a true connection, she’ll understand.\nHolding her and kissing her on the neck at the right moment and at the right place. Perhaps you’re on a beach watching the sunset. This action might say much more than words could communicate.\nBe warned that this approach might be considered a cop-out by some, and might not actually communicate what you want. Only you and your partner can know.\n"

After acquiring the UK-based streaming and DVD-by-mail service LoveFilm in 2011, Prime Video was added to the Prime subscription in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria in 2014, available on a monthly subscription of £/€8.99 per month, continuing the plan of LoveFilm Instant. The service was previously available in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in 2012, but was discontinued in 2013. On April 18, 2016, Amazon split Prime Video from Amazon Prime in the US for $8.99 per month.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Microorganisms play a crucial role in the decomposition process, breaking down organic matter into simpler compounds that can be recycled back into the ecosystem. In extreme environments such as deep sea vents or high altitude glaciers, the decomposition process is affected by the harsh conditions, including high pressure, low temperature, and limited nutrients. \nDeep sea vents are one of the most extreme environments on Earth, where the water temperature can reach up to 400°C and the pressure can exceed 1000 times that at the surface. Despite these conditions, microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea have adapted to survive in this environment and play a key role in the decomposition process. These microorganisms are able to use chemosynthesis to obtain energy from inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, instead of relying on sunlight for photosynthesis. This process provides a source of energy for other organisms in the deep sea vent ecosystem, including those involved in the decomposition process.\nHigh altitude glaciers are another extreme environment where microorganisms play a crucial role in the decomposition process. These environments are characterized by low temperatures, high UV radiation, and limited nutrients. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae have adapted to survive in these conditions, using specialized enzymes and pigments to break down organic matter and protect themselves from UV radiation. These microorganisms are also able to form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as lichens, which help to stabilize the soil and promote the growth of other plants.\nThe impact of microorganisms on the decomposition process in extreme environments has important implications for global biogeochemical cycles and climate change. For example, the deep sea vents are thought to play a significant role in the cycling of carbon and other elements, which can affect the Earth's climate over long periods of time. Similarly, the decomposition of organic matter in high altitude glaciers can release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming.\nIn conclusion, microorganisms play a crucial role in the decomposition process in extreme environments, such as deep sea vents or high altitude glaciers. These microorganisms have adapted to survive in these harsh conditions, using specialized enzymes, pigments, and symbiotic relationships to break down organic matter and obtain energy. The impact of these microorganisms on global biogeochemical cycles and climate change highlights the importance of understanding their ecology and adaptations for survival."

Schedule Assessment: The algorithm would then assess the user's schedule to determine how much time they have available for studying each day.\n4. Content Selection: Based on the user's learning style, goals, and schedule, the algorithm would select the best content for the user to study. This could include videos, articles, or interactive activities.\n5. Study Plan Generation: Finally, the algorithm would generate a personalized study plan for the user. This plan would include a recommended study schedule, as well as specific content recommendations based on the user's learning style and goals.\nThe algorithm could also be designed to adjust the study plan over time based on the user's progress and feedback. For example, if the user is struggling with a particular topic, the algorithm could recommend additional resources or adjust the study schedule to allow for more practice time."

Some brands of extra-virgin olive oil can cost considerably more, comparatively, than other available cooking oils. And you’d have to buy lot of olive oil to match this diet — participants received a whopping 1 L per week per family. Other foods in the Mediterranean diet (e.g. fish and nuts) are also relatively expensive. So the release fails at this category, although it is a minor failure in this case considering the relative strength of the rest of the release. The release points out that the participants following the Mediterranean Diet supplemented by EVOO experienced a 68 percent lower relative risk of breast cancer than did the control group. While that’s one way to report the findings, we always ask that stories also include a measure of the absolute risk, which provides important additional information to help readers gauge the size of the benefit. These absolute risk figures were reported in the study abstract and could have easily been included in the release as well. The researchers found breast cancer rates of 1.1 per thousand people per year in the Med Diet plus EVOO group, 1.8 per thousand people per year in the Med Diet plus nuts group, and 2.9 per thousand people per year in the control group. Consuming both nuts and olive oil have been shown in numerous studies to be a positive asset to the regular diet. And yet these foods are very calorie-dense, and so one wonders if consuming so much of them could increase the risk for weight gain, which is in turn associated with breast cancer risk. But the release’s lack of discussion on that point shouldn’t be enough for a Not Satisfactory rating — we’ll rule it Not Applicable. This release described a large, multi-center, randomized trial where those analyzing the data were blinded to information that might influence their findings. It gave ample information about the study design, it’s relationship to the larger cardiovascular study from which it is derived, and the size, scope, age and body mass of the participants. The release also does a good job following the research paper’s example of delineating the weaknesses of the study. It even quotes the cautionary language included in an accompanying editorial. This release offers no evidence of disease-mongering. The release only offers the following statement as an endnote: “Authors made conflict of interest and funding/support disclosures. Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures.”  The paper itself points to numerous connections between the researchers and sponsors which would have an obvious vested interest in the study’s outcome. These include grants as well as free supplies of the foods supplemented in the study. While this doesn’t call the findings into question, disclosing this information in a release of this type provides transparency that readers appreciate and should expect. The release offers no real alternatives to the diets studied but it is reasonable to assume that readers can compare these examples with their own diets and make decisions accordingly. And while there are other approaches to cancer prevention that arguably could have been discussed (screening mammography, for example), we don’t really think a release about a diet study should be expected to address those approaches. It’s clear from the release that the foods in the Mediterranean diet are widely available. However, it might be harder to find certain component foods like fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, and extra virgin olive oil in some places in the U.S. (i.e. “food deserts”). The release could have acknowledged this. The release establishes that the effects of diet on breast cancer risk have been studied previously with this line: “Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.” There is no unjustifiable language in this release. Claim: Mediterranean diet plus olive oil associated with reduced breast cancer risk\"",
        "input": "",
        "output": "This news release reports on the findings of a large European study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, asking whether older women participants following a Mediterranean Diet, supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts, experienced a different rate of breast cancer than women receiving straightforward dietary advice. The outcome showed that those supplemented with EVOO experienced fewer cases of breast cancer than did the control group or the group supplemented with nuts. Overall, the release does an excellent job of summarizing the results of the study and putting the evidence in context. The study’s numerous limitations are addressed, and the release also quotes from an accompanying editorial that provides a valuable independent perspective. The release would have benefited from inclusion of absolute risk numbers and some acknowledgment that the diet studied here could be costly to follow. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. If the risk of this disease can be lowered by simply altering one’s diet, it would represent a safe, non-pharmacological approach to improving the public’s health."

        "output": "A well-written formal essay requires several components to effectively convey the intended message to the audience. These components include an engaging introduction, a clear thesis statement, well-organized body paragraphs with supporting evidence, effective transitions, and a compelling conclusion.\nThe introduction should grab the reader's attention and provide context for the topic. This can be achieved through the use of a hook, such as a quote or anecdote, followed by background information that sets the stage for the thesis statement. The thesis statement should clearly state the main argument or point of the essay.\nThe body paragraphs should be well-organized and support the thesis statement with evidence and examples. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that relates back to the thesis statement and provide evidence to support the argument. It's important to use reliable sources to back up claims and avoid logical fallacies.\nEffective transitions are crucial in formal writing to ensure the essay flows smoothly from one idea to the next. Transitions can be achieved through the use of transitional words or phrases, such as \"however\" or \"in addition.\" These words help to connect ideas and create a cohesive narrative.\nA compelling conclusion should summarize the main points of the essay and restate the thesis statement in a new way. It's important to avoid introducing new information in the conclusion and instead focus on providing closure to the essay.\nProper formatting, citation style, and language usage are also important in formal writing. Formatting should be consistent throughout the essay, including font size and style, margins, and spacing. Citation style should also be consistent and follow the guidelines of the chosen citation style, such as APA or MLA. Language usage should be formal and avoid slang or colloquialisms.\nTo improve each aspect of the essay, consider the intended audience and purpose of the piece. For example, if the audience is a group of academics, the language usage should be more technical and the sources should be scholarly. If the purpose of the essay is to persuade the reader, the body paragraphs should include strong evidence and examples to support the argument.\nIn summary, a well-written formal essay requires an engaging introduction, a clear thesis statement, well-organized body paragraphs with supporting evidence, effective transitions, and a compelling conclusion. Proper formatting, citation style, and language usage are also important to consider. To improve each aspect of the essay, consider the intended audience and purpose of the piece."

If a plant's bloom pattern is not one of these options, it will be sorted last.\nThe query will also alternate the colors of the plants for aesthetic purposes. It does this by using the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign a number to each plant based on its color, then using modulo arithmetic to determine whether that number is odd or even. Plants with odd-numbered colors will appear first, followed by plants with even-numbered colors.\nOf course, you'll need to modify this query to match the structure and column names of your own SQL database.

        "output": "1. Choose the equation you want to work with first.: It doesn’t matter which equation you choose, but you might want to look for one that will give you numbers that are easier to work with.\nFor example, if your simultaneous equations are 1) x+2y=−4{\\displaystyle x+2y=-4} and 2) 2x+5y=1{\\displaystyle 2x+5y=1}, you will probably want to begin with the first equation, because the x{\\displaystyle x} is already by itself.\n2. Isolate the x{\\displaystyle x} variable in the first equation.: You could also start by isolating the y variable (or whatever other variable the equation uses).\nFor example, if you are beginning with x+2y=−4{\\displaystyle x+2y=-4}, you could solve for x{\\displaystyle x} by subtracting 2y from each side.x+2y=−4{\\displaystyle x+2y=-4}x=−4−2y{\\displaystyle x=-4-2y}\n3. Plug in the value of x{\\displaystyle x} into the second equation.: Place the value in parentheses for clarity.\nFor example, if you found x=−4−2y{\\displaystyle x=-4-2y} in the first equation, plug in −4−2y{\\displaystyle -4-2y} for x{\\displaystyle x} in the second equation:2x+5y=1{\\displaystyle 2x+5y=1}2(−4−2y)+5y=1{\\displaystyle 2(-4-2y)+5y=1}\n4. Find the value of y{\\displaystyle y} in the second equation.: Remember to follow the order of operations.\nFor example, to solve for y{\\displaystyle y} in the equation 2(−4−2y)+5=1{\\displaystyle 2(-4-2y)+5=1}, first use the distributive property to multiply.2(−4−2y)+5y=1{\\displaystyle 2(-4-2y)+5y=1}−8−4y+5y=1{\\displaystyle -8-4y+5y=1}−8+y=1{\\displaystyle -8+y=1}y=9{\\displaystyle y=9}\n5. Plug in the y{\\displaystyle y} value into either equation.: It doesn’t matter which equation you use, as long as you use the original equation, or an equation where you’ve isolated the x{\\displaystyle x} variable. This will allow you to find the value for x{\\displaystyle x}.\n\nIf you plug the y{\\displaystyle y} value back into the second equation with the x{\\displaystyle x} substitution, you will not be able to find the value of x{\\displaystyle x}.\n\nFor example, if you found y=9{\\displaystyle y=9}, plug in 9{\\displaystyle 9} for y{\\displaystyle y} in the first equation:x+2y=−4{\\displaystyle x+2y=-4}x+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}\n6. Find the value of x{\\displaystyle x}.: Remember to follow the order of operations.\nFor example, to solve for x{\\displaystyle x} in the equation x+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}, first multiply, and then subtract 18 from each side to find the value of x{\\displaystyle x}.x+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}x+18=−4{\\displaystyle x+18=-4}x=−22{\\displaystyle x=-22}.\n7. Check your work.: To do this, substitute the values you found for x{\\displaystyle x} and y{\\displaystyle y} into both equations, and verify that the resulting equation are true.\n\nFor example, if you found y=9{\\displaystyle y=9} and x=−22{\\displaystyle x=-22}, substitute these values into both equations.\nSo, for the first equation:(−22)+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle (-22)+2(9)=-4}−22+18=−4{\\displaystyle -22+18=-4}−4=−4{\\displaystyle -4=-4}\n\nFor the second equation:2(−22)+5(9)=1{\\displaystyle 2(-22)+5(9)=1}−44+45=1{\\displaystyle -44+45=1}1=1{\\displaystyle 1=1}\n"

Over the course of this five-minute presentation, I will talk about the importance of recycling and the positive impact it can have on the environment.\n\nRecycling allows us to reuse materials that can be used more than once. This is beneficial for many reasons: it reduces the production of waste, and it can also save money. It also reduces the need to use energy and resources to create new products from raw materials.\n\nIn addition to this, recycling helps conserve our natural resources, such as energy and water. By reusing materials, we are able to reduce the amount of water and energy needed to produce new materials. This can help us preserve our environment and reduce the amount of energy we use to create and maintain products.\n\nAnother important benefit of recycling is that it can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Recycling and reusing materials means creating demand for associated services, such as sorting, collecting, and packaging. This can help create jobs as well as provide cheaper materials and services.\n\nFinally, recycling can help reduce air and water pollution. By producing fewer waste materials and using what we have, we can reduce the amount of toxic materials in our environment. This can help make our environment healthier and safer for future generations.\n\nSo, to recap, recycling can save money, conserve natural resources, create jobs, and reduce pollution. It is a great way to contribute to the health of our environment and our future. Thank you for your time and attention."

Fast food items are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sodium, which can lead to bloating, indigestion, and dehydration. Additionally, fast food items are often low in essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies.\nIn the long-term, frequent consumption of fast food can lead to a range of health problems such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Genetic predispositions, lifestyle habits, and comorbidities can also play a role in the severity of these health problems.\nComparing the nutritional content of fast food items from various fast-food chains, it is evident that some chains offer healthier options than others. For example, Subway offers a range of healthy sandwich options that are low in calories and high in nutrients, while McDonald's offers items that are high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sodium. However, even the healthier options at fast-food chains are often high in sodium and low in fiber.\nTo mitigate the negative health effects of fast food consumption, fast-food chains can modify their preparation and ingredient choices. For example, they can use healthier cooking methods such as grilling or baking instead of frying. They can also incorporate more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables into their menu items. Additionally, they can reduce the amount of sodium in their food and offer smaller portion sizes.\nOverall, the short-term and long-term implications of fast food consumption on one's health are significant. It is important to make informed choices when consuming fast food and to prioritize healthier options whenever possible."

Remember, moderators cannot \"vote to close\", once they click on \"close\" the question immediately changes to \"on hold\" status. This becomes \"closed\" a week later automatically if nothing happens, but new answers are prevented from being posted immediately.\nTo us veterans, having one of our comments deleted or a question closed is old hat. But to newbies, it can feel wrenching. We've just had a new GLU member close out their account after half a dozen questions. While they did not explain their decision, it's possible that having their question closed by a moderator after only one user had voted to close was the cause.\nWhat's the rush?

Answers we already had did now look rather off topic.\nConsequently the question was correctly flagged for putting on hold. We asked the OP again for clarification but sadly this did never happen.\nWe do not know why the OP decided to close their account but it may also be that they were not too happy with their question being so radically edited.\nOnly one other question from user 3097 was correctly closed as dupe with 4 community close votes and mine.\nPlease do not hesitate to name further examples where you felt a \"premature\" moderator action took place.

It's absolutely not clear what is being asked. I don't agree with the recent changes, because I think the initial problem of OP were different. It's not possible to give a good answer to this question as long we don't know what's exactly OP's problem.\n\nFortunately, @Takkat responded very quickly. He put the question on hold, and he also left a comment in order to motivate OP to, eventually, edit his question.\nHe had enough time to do so.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Markets have been on the edge regarding Italy's future spending, but there are other countries challenging European fiscal rules.\nFrance, the second-largest economy in Europe, received a letter from Brussels last week, warning that its planned debt reduction in 2019 does not respect the proposals that Paris had agreed previously with the EU. Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Slovenia were also effectively told off by the EU.\nIn the case of France, the 2019 budget plan sees its structural deficit (the difference between spending and revenues, excluding one-off items) falling 0.1 percent this year and 0.3 percent in 2019. Paris had agreed in April to an annual reduction of 0.6 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) for its structural deficit.\nThough the tone of the warning from Brussels to Paris was softer than the tone towards Rome, the two countries have perhaps more similarities than differences.\nThe French 2019 budget \"shows that the government relies heavily on very optimistic revenues to achieve fiscal consolidation and that spending is out of control again,\" Daniel Lacalle, chief economist and investment officer at Tressis Gestion, told CNBC via email.\nItaly has also been criticized for having very upbeat economic forecasts in its 2019 budget plan.\n\"In the case of France, it is a very difficult budget to accept by the European Commission because France has not had a balanced budget since 1974 and has missed its own deficit targets more than eleven times,\" Lacalle added.\nData from the European statistics agency, Eurostat, shows that since it started collecting French data in 1978, France has never registered a budget surplus. Italy, which has provided data since 1995, has also never presented a budget surplus.\nA report from credit ratings agency Moody's, released Tuesday, showed that nominal budget deficits (the actual deficit without adjusting for the impact of inflation) in the euro area have dropped since 2008. However, \"the aggregate share of mandatory spending in euro area budgets has actually risen to 76.3 percent of total spending from 74.5 percent in 2008.\"\n\"This increase mainly reflects a rise in spending on social security and assistance, pensions, education and health care,\" the report said.\nFrance, traditionally seen as a welfare state, has promised in its 2019 budget plan to reform the way benefits are calculated.\nAccording to Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the commitment to reforms is one of the big differences between France and Italy. While the government in France wants to go ahead and change certain areas, the executive in Rome has backtracked on key reforms that the previous government had implemented, including an overhaul to the pension system.\nFlorian Hense, an economist at Berenberg, also told CNBC via email that at a first glance the French budget might be even worse than Italy's, but added that the big difference is the rhetoric coming from the Italian government.\n\"Taken at face value, the French budget plans do not look much better than the Italian's, in fact they look worse. But, while France is credibly working on improving its long-run growth potential (by strengthening both the demand and supply side of the economy), Italy is doing the opposite (think a lower retirement age and fiscal spending channeled through to consumption rather than investment),\" he said.\nOverall, France has promised to lower its total government debt in 2019, but by a very thin margin. While France's debt is set to hit 98.7 percent of GDP in 2018, it is forecast to fall by 0.1 percentage points in 2019 to 98.6 percent.\nLooking at Italy, the government said that the country's debt ratio will decline from 131.2 percent of GDP in 2017 to 126.7 percent in 2021.\nEurope's fiscal rules suggest that countries should not exceed a debt ratio of 60 percent. Data from Eurostat has shown that both of these founding countries of the EU have struggled to keep their debt ratios below that threshold. But the situation seems far worse in Italy, where since 1995, debt-to-GDP has always been above 100 percent.\nDespite the deviation from the rules, the European Commission has never sanctioned a member state, though it has legal ground to do that. However, the Commission has gone one step further on Tuesday in relation to Italy's latest budget — it asked for a resubmission, meaning that it does not think the Italian budget is good enough. This has never happened before.\nNonetheless, Italy keeps comparing itself to France. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini last month questioned on Twitter why Italy's 2019 planned deficit is a problem (which is set to be 2.4 percent) when France has breached the 3 percent threshold for years.\n\"But how, if France and Spain have been extending the 3 percent ceiling for years, nobody says anything, while if Italy tries to touch it to secure the country and boost the consumption of Italians is a problem?,\" Salvini said.\nBut Juvyns told CNBC that the French and the Italian economies are not the same, \"because the debt-to-GDP level is different.\""

However, I can provide you with a general outline for such a system. Here are some key components that a system for processing customers' orders might include:\n\n1. Online or Point of Sale (POS) Interface: The system should have an online or POS interface to allow customers to place orders quickly and easily. This interface should be user-friendly, secure, and accessible from any device. The customer interface should ask for order details like the name, address, order items, and payment information.\n\n2. Order Management: The system should have an order management feature that allows the restaurant or business owner to view and process all incoming orders. It should show the status of each order (such as \"pending,\" \"in progress,\" or \"delivered\"), and allow the owner to send push notifications, emails, or text messages to customers regarding their orders.\n\n3. Inventory Management: The system should also have an inventory management feature that monitors item availability and manages stock levels. It should send alerts when items are running low or out of stock, allowing the business owner to update the menu immediately.\n\n4. Payment Processing: The system must have a payment processing functionality to ensure a seamless, secure, and fast payment process. This will help the restaurant or business owner to reduce issues like payment fraud, transaction errors, payment gateway integration, etc.\n\n5. Reporting: Reporting is an essential feature of any order management system. The system should be able to generate sales reports, track inventory levels, and monitor customer buying patterns to help the business owner make data-driven decisions to improve the business.\n\n6. Integration: The system should allow integration with third-party apps or services like Google Maps, GrubHub, UberEats, etc. This will not only increase the visibility of the business, but it will also help owners to receive orders from different sources in a single place.\n\nThese features would create an efficient system that can help businesses process orders effectively, minimize errors, and provide a better customer experience."

        "input": "",
        "output": "To create a program that predicts the future market share of a business, we need to consider several factors such as past performance, industry trends, economic conditions, and consumer behavior. Here is a possible approach to build such a program:\n1. Collect and analyze historical data: The first step is to gather data on the business's past performance and market share over a certain period, say five years. We can also collect data on industry trends, economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and consumer behavior such as spending patterns, preferences, and demographics.\n2. Identify key variables: Based on the analysis of historical data, we need to identify the variables that have the most impact on the business's market share. For example, we may find that the business's pricing strategy, product quality, marketing efforts, and customer service have a significant influence on its market share.\n3. Develop a predictive model: Once we have identified the key variables, we can develop a predictive model that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast the business's market share in the future. The model should take into account the historical data and external factors such as changes in the economy and consumer behavior.\n4. Validate the model: We need to validate the predictive model by testing it on a subset of the historical data and comparing its predictions to the actual market share. If the model performs well, we can use it to make predictions for future periods.\n5. Monitor and update the model: Finally, we need to monitor the business's performance and update the predictive model periodically to incorporate new data and changes in the external environment. This will ensure that the model remains accurate and relevant over time.\nOverall, building a program that predicts the future market share of a business is a complex task that requires expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. However, with the right approach and tools, we can develop a reliable and actionable forecast that can help businesses make informed decisions about their future growth strategies."

In 1935 a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Heat transfer is the process by which thermal energy is exchanged between two or more different media. This exchange of thermal energy can occur through three main mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation.\n\n1. Conduction: Heat transfer by conduction occurs when two objects are in direct contact with one another. The hotter object will transfer heat to the cooler object until both objects reach the same temperature. For example, when you touch a hot stove, heat is transferred from the stove to your hand through conduction.\n\n2. Convection: Heat transfer by convection occurs when a fluid, such as air or water, moves and carries heat with it. When a fluid is heated, it becomes less dense and rises, while cooler, denser fluid sinks. This creates convection currents that transfer heat. For example, when you boil water on a stove, the hot water rises to the top and is replaced by cooler water, creating a convection current.\n\n3. Radiation: Heat transfer by radiation occurs when electromagnetic waves travel through space and are absorbed by an object. This can occur through visible light, infrared radiation, and other types of electromagnetic radiation. For example, the sun heats the Earth through radiation.\n\nIn summary, heat transfer occurs through conduction, convection, and radiation, and it is an essential process for regulating temperature and energy in our environment."

        "output": "Accurately estimating the total number of individuals in an image while considering obscured individuals or reflections, classifying them based on attributes like age, gender, or clothing, and improving the accuracy of the count by incorporating machine learning algorithms can be a complex task. However, here are some general steps you can take to get started:\n1. Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of images with varying numbers of individuals, different ages, genders, and clothing. This dataset should also include images with obscured individuals or reflections.\n2. Image Preprocessing: Preprocess the images to improve the accuracy of the count. This can include techniques like background subtraction, image segmentation, and object detection.\n3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the images that can be used to classify individuals based on age, gender, or clothing. This can include features like facial features, body shape, and clothing color.\n4. Machine Learning: Train a machine learning model on the dataset to accurately estimate the total number of individuals in an image and classify them based on attributes like age, gender, or clothing. This can include techniques like deep learning and convolutional neural networks.\n5. Confidence Interval: Once the machine learning model is trained, you can use it to estimate the total number of individuals in an image and provide a confidence interval to measure the level of certainty in the estimation. This can be done by using statistical techniques like bootstrapping or Bayesian inference.\nHere is some sample code in JavaScript that uses TensorFlow.js, a popular JavaScript library for machine learning, to perform object detection and classification on an image:\n```javascript\n// Load the TensorFlow.js library\nconst tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');\n// Load the object detection model\nconst objectDetectionModel = await tf.loadGraphModel('https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/ssd_mobilenet_v2/2');\n// Load the classification model\nconst classificationModel = await tf.loadGraphModel('https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/classification/4');\n// Load the image\nconst image = await tf.node.decodeImage(imageBuffer);\n// Perform object detection\nconst objectDetectionResult = await objectDetectionModel.executeAsync(image);\n// Extract the bounding boxes from the object detection result\nconst boundingBoxes = objectDetectionResult[0].arraySync()[0];\n// Extract the cropped images from the bounding boxes\nconst croppedImages = boundingBoxes.map(box => tf.image.cropAndResize(image, [box], [0], [224, 224]));\n// Perform classification on the cropped images\nconst classificationResults = await Promise.all(croppedImages.map(image => classificationModel.executeAsync(image)));\n// Extract the classifications from the classification results\nconst classifications = classificationResults.map(result => result[0].arraySync()[0]);\n// Count the number of individuals in the image\nconst totalIndividuals = classifications.filter(classification => classification.label === 'person').length;\n// Classify the individuals based on age, gender, or clothing\nconst ageClassifications = classifications.filter(classification => classification.label === 'age');\nconst genderClassifications = classifications.filter(classification => classification.label === 'gender');\nconst clothingClassifications = classifications.filter(classification => classification.label === 'clothing');\n// Calculate the confidence interval\nconst confidenceInterval = calculateConfidenceInterval(totalIndividuals, classifications);\n```\nNote that this is just a sample code and will require significant modifications to work with your specific use case.

Your response should include detailed information on their viability, limitations, and potential for commercialization.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Certainly! There are several lesser-known sources of renewable energy that have the potential to play a significant role in our energy mix. Here are some examples:\n1. Ocean energy: The ocean is a vast and largely untapped source of renewable energy. There are two main types of ocean energy: wave energy and tidal energy. Wave energy is generated by the motion of waves, while tidal energy is generated by the rise and fall of the tides. Both of these sources have the potential to produce significant amounts of electricity, but they are still in the early stages of development and are not yet widely used.\n2. Geothermal energy: Geothermal energy is generated by the heat of the earth's core. It can be harnessed through geothermal power plants, which use steam or hot water to generate electricity. Geothermal energy is a reliable and consistent source of renewable energy, but it is limited to areas with high geothermal activity.\n3. Bioenergy: Bioenergy is generated from organic matter such as wood, crops, and waste. It can be used to produce electricity, heat, and fuel. Bioenergy is a versatile source of renewable energy, but it can be limited by the availability of biomass and the environmental impact of its production.\n4. Hydrogen: Hydrogen is a clean-burning fuel that can be produced from renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It can be used to power vehicles, heat homes, and generate electricity. However, the production of hydrogen is currently expensive and requires significant infrastructure investment.\n5. Solar thermal energy: Solar thermal energy uses mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a receiver, which heats a fluid to generate steam and drive a turbine. This technology has the potential to produce large amounts of electricity, but it is still in the early stages of development.\nAs for experimental sources of renewable energy, there are several cutting-edge technologies that are being explored, such as:\n1. Fusion energy: Fusion energy is generated by combining atomic nuclei to release energy. It has the potential to produce large amounts of clean energy, but it is still in the experimental stage and faces significant technical challenges.\n2. Artificial photosynthesis: Artificial photosynthesis uses sunlight to produce hydrogen from water. This technology has the potential to produce a clean and renewable source of fuel, but it is still in the early stages of development.\n3. Piezoelectric energy: Piezoelectric energy is generated by applying pressure to certain materials, which generates an electrical charge. This technology has the potential to generate electricity from sources such as foot traffic or ocean waves, but it is still in the experimental stage.\nOverall, these sources of renewable energy have varying degrees of viability, limitations, and potential for commercialization. While some are already being used on a large scale, others are still in the experimental stage and require significant investment to become commercially viable. However, as technology continues to advance and the demand for clean energy grows, these sources have the potential to play an increasingly important role in our energy mix."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Who has been the best rookie this season -- Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell?\nWhich rookie postseason star is the real ROY?\nThis year's NBA Rookie of the Year debate, one of the most fiercely contested in some time, has continued raging well after awards ballots were due two and a half weeks ago.\nWhile most rookies either play small roles for contending teams or put up bigger per-game numbers on lottery-bound ones, Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz and Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers have been driving forces in their teams' advancing to the second round of the playoffs.\nAs Mitchell and Simmons continue to shine on a bigger stage, let's revisit the question: Who has been this year's most valuable rookie?\nThe case for Mitchell as Rookie of the Year centered largely on his leading role in the Jazz's offense. Utah's 48 wins during the regular season were the most by a team led in scoring by a rookie since the 1989-90 San Antonio Spurs, who won 56 games behind rookie David Robinson (who was 24 at the time, having spent four years in college and two more serving in the Navy).\nA focus on scoring does a disservice to Simmons' involvement in the 76ers' attack. While both Joel Embiid (22.9 ppg) and JJ Redick (17.1 ppg) scored more points than Simmons (15.8 ppg), Simmons ranked fifth in the league with 8.2 assists per game -- more than double Mitchell's 3.7 assist average.\nLast season, I introduced the stat \"combined usage\" to quantify a player's role in the offense as both a scorer and a passer, adding the percentage of the team's plays that he finished with a shot, trip to the free throw line or turnover (traditional usage rate) to those on which he handed out an assist. While Mitchell still comes out slightly ahead, both players played historically large roles for rookies on winning teams.\nAlthough Mitchell and Simmons operated in very different styles -- Mitchell creating primarily for himself, Simmons primarily for others -- their overall offensive value as rookies was similar. Basketball-Reference.com's box plus-minus metric (BPM) gives Mitchell the slight edge (plus-1.3 offensive BPM to Simmons' 1.0), as does ESPN's real plus-minus (plus-1.7 for Mitchell, plus-1.5 for Simmons).\nAlthough Mitchell might deserve the nod as offensive Rookie of the Year, Simmons distinguishes himself at the defensive end of the court. Mitchell entered the league advertised as a strong defender -- that was probably considered his better skill as a prospect -- and lived up to expectations as part of the NBA's second-best defense during the regular season.\nNonetheless, Simmons was the more valuable defender. Part of that is simply about size and positional value. The 6-foot-3 Mitchell naturally matched up almost exclusively against perimeter players, whereas the 6-foot-10 Simmons was one of the league's most versatile defenders. He defended both guard spots and both forward spots at least 20 percent of the time and none more than 30 percent, per Second Spectrum matchup data, which tracks a player's defensive assignment for the majority of a given play.\nThen there were Simmons' box-score contributions on defense. He rebounded nearly 20 percent of opponents' missed shots, making him above average for a power forward. Simmons was one of 16 regular players (minimum 1,000 minutes) in the league to average at least two steals per 100 team plays on defense and block at least 2 percent of opponent 2-point attempts.\nIn an era when few rookies are immediately productive, Simmons, in particular, stood as an exception. His 10.1 wins above replacement player (WARP) by my metric ranked fourth among all rookies in the one-and-done era.\nBy this metric, Mitchell -- 24th in the one-and-done era with 5.2 WARP -- was less exceptional. But switching to RPM supports the notion that this was one of the strongest Rookie of the Year battles in recent memory. Both Simmons and Mitchell rank among the top 10 rookies of the past 18 seasons by RPM wins above replacement (WAR), which dates to 2000-01 -- as does Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics, the likely third-place finisher in Rookie of the Year voting.\nGiven how effective they were during the regular season, it's all the more remarkable that Mitchell and Simmons have both been even better in the playoffs.\nJust as it has become rare for rookies to contribute as much to winning teams as Mitchell and Simmons have, so too has it been out of the ordinary for them to be such big factors in the postseason. Back through 2000, this year's duo ranks among the top six rookies in WARP per game in a playoff run of at least six games.\nMitchell's playoff run has been compared to that of Dwyane Wade leading the Miami Heat to the second round in 2004, and that holds up in terms of advanced statistics. While Wade didn't shoulder as heavy an offensive load as Mitchell, who is finishing an incredible 32 percent of the Jazz's plays in the postseason, Wade handed out 6.9 assists per 100 team plays -- more than double Mitchell's playoff mark. As such, they were similarly valuable in the playoffs.\nWith Embiid sidelined the first two games, Simmons was Philadelphia's best player in a comfortable 4-1 series win over the Heat. Even after a seven-turnover performance in the 76ers' Game 1 loss to the Boston Celtics, Simmons is posting the most WARP per game by a rookie in an extended playoff run since Tim Duncan in 1998.\nIn three of the past four seasons, Mitchell would have been an easy choice for Rookie of the Year, and in 2015-16, his strong RPM would have given him a reasonable case over Towns' superior box score stats. It's to Mitchell's slight misfortune that he happens to be putting together a strong rookie campaign at the same time Simmons has posted one of the best in recent memory.\nFortunately, while only one can win Rookie of the Year, there's plenty of room for both Mitchell and Simmons to emerge as stars in this postseason and beyond."

model that allows website owners to scale up or down as needed.\n- Public servers are highly scalable, allowing website owners to quickly and easily add resources to accommodate high traffic volumes.\n- Public servers are typically managed by experienced professionals who can ensure fast and reliable performance.\nLimits of hosting on a public server:\n- Public servers are typically shared with other users, which can increase the risk of security breaches and data theft.\n- Public servers may not be able to provide the level of customization and control that some website owners require.\n- Public servers may be subject to data sovereignty laws and geopolitical risks, which can impact website performance and security.\nBenefits of hosting on a private server:\n- Private

as they are not shared with other users.\n- Private servers can be located in specific geographic regions to comply with data sovereignty laws and minimize geopolitical risks.\nLimits of hosting on a private server:\n- Private servers can be more expensive than public servers, as they require a larger upfront investment in hardware and infrastructure.\n- Private servers may require more maintenance and management, as website owners are responsible for ensuring their own security and performance.\n- Private servers may not be as scalable as public servers, which can limit their

However, private cloud infrastructures offer greater control and customization options, which can be beneficial for websites with specific needs.\nIn terms of maintenance requirements, public cloud services like AWS or Azure are generally easier to maintain, as they are managed by experienced professionals who can ensure fast and reliable performance. Private cloud infrastructures like OpenStack or VMware require more maintenance and management, as website owners are responsible for ensuring their own security and performance.\nFinally, hosting location can have a significant impact on website performance and security. Data sovereignty laws and geopolitical risks can impact the location of the website's infrastructure, and website owners should carefully consider these factors when choosing a hosting location. Additionally, website owners should ensure that their infrastructure is properly secured and regularly monitored to prevent security breaches and data theft."

For example, swapping out old incandescent light bulbs for LED bulbs can significantly reduce energy usage.\n2. Implement energy-saving practices: Encourage employees to turn off lights and equipment when they are not in use, and adjust the thermostat to reduce heating and cooling costs. Consider implementing a company-wide policy on energy conservation to encourage everyone to do their part.\nThe benefits of implementing these strategies can be significant. By reducing energy consumption, businesses can save money on their utility bills and reduce their carbon footprint.

We then define a `generateBirthdayMessages` function that takes a vector of friends as input and generates a personalized message for each friend using string concatenation and formatting. Finally, we call the `generateBirthdayMessages` function with a vector of three friends and print the resulting messages to the console.\nNote that this is just one possible solution and the exact implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements and preferences."

        "instruction": "As a beginner in manage workplace stress, what are the 21 basic steps I should take?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "1. Try a special breathing pattern if you feel stressed or irritated.: Pretend you’re sipping air through a straw and breathe in with your mouth. After inhaling, exhale through your nose. Repeat this process several times to help yourself calm down in a stressful or frustrating situation.\nGet in the habit of breathing this way even if you aren’t stressed out. This will help you master the technique so you can use it when you really need to.\n2. Relax your muscles and breathe deeply to help yourself relax.: Find a comfortable position in your chair at work and close your eyes. Start by tensing your feet and lower legs for 10 seconds, then relax the muscles for 20 seconds. Repeat this process by working your way up your body, going to your knees and thighs, hips, abdomen, and so on. Try out this relaxation method if you’ve just dealt with a stressful situation at the workplace.\n\nThis is a great strategy to use if you’re ever feeling anxious.\nAs you loosen your muscles, consciously bring the word “relax” to mind.\n3. Change your perspective to better cope with negative situations.: Take a step back from a tense situation and try to separate yourself from your frustrated, unproductive thoughts and feelings. Switch your mindset and examine the situation from another person’s point of view to give yourself some perspective, which may help de-escalate any stressful feelings.\n\nFor instance, if you’re an employee who just got in a fight with a coworker, step back and think over their thoughts and motivations. This may provide some clarity to the argument that you had.\nIf you’re an employer, give yourself time to think over a stressful situation, like an employee lashing out, before taking direct action.\n4. Focus on problems and situations that you can control.: Break tough situations and projects into smaller chunks. Think about what you can control versus what you can’t, and put your energy into things that you have some control over.\n\nFor instance, if you only have 1 day to finish a project, focus on what needs to be done in the project instead of the deadline.\nClear, productive thinking can help reduce stress.\n5. Arrive at work a little early so you feel ahead of the game.: Set your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier so you can get a jumpstart on your morning routine. Try to head out the door about 10-15 minutes early, so you have an extra window to relax and prepare yourself for the day at work.\nMake your breakfast and lunch ahead of time so you can head out the door right away.\n6. Make a game plan for dealing with possible interruptions.: Anticipate the fact that people will interrupt you during your workday and decide what to do if and when someone disturbs your concentration. To avoid these unwanted disturbances, try giving yourself office hours, or request that your coworkers email you instead of speaking to you directly.\n\nSome interruptions will take longer than others. A quick question probably won’t disturb your focus as much as a personal conversation.\nFor instance, you can say something like: “Hey! I’d love to chat but I’m in the middle of a project right now and can’t give you my full attention. Can we meet up at lunch instead?”\n7. Clean up your work space if it’s on the messy side.: Look over your desk or work area and see if it’s affecting your morale. If your space is cluttered and messy, you may feel some lingering stress and disorganization. In your free time, take a few minutes to sort and recycle leftover papers, and toss out anything you don’t need.\nTry getting in the habit of cleaning your desk once a week, so your workspace is completely clean.\n8. Work on the most important projects first.: Make a list of everything you need to do over the next few days and weeks. Organize your list by time-sensitive projects versus projects that aren’t as important at the moment. Dedicate your energy to the most important projects instead of stressing over multiple things at once.\nFor instance, if you have to write a holiday newsletter and reorganize some spreadsheets, focus on the newsletter first.\n9. Refrain from committing to too many projects.: Make a list or note of the projects you’re involved in currently. Don’t overwork yourself—if you’re already spread thin, politely mention that you can’t handle any more work at the moment. Once your schedule clears up, you can always take on more projects later!\n10. Give yourself breaks throughout the work day.: Choose times throughout your workday where you can take 5 minutes to stretch or grab a drink of water. Don’t overwork yourself—instead, give yourself time to breathe and relax, which may help reduce your stress.\nFor instance, if you work from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 to 5:00 PM, you can take a 5-minute break at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM.\n11. Delegate work to others if you feel overwhelmed.: Let your co-workers know if you have too much on your plate at once. Politely ask another person if they can handle some of the work so your schedule feels a bit less stressed and more manageable.\nFor instance, you can say something like: “I’ve gotten my hands full with this current project and I don’t think I can get everything done. Would you be okay with making these phone calls for me while I work on this?”\n12. Talk to your boss about ways you can get rid of your stressors.: Set an appointment with your boss or supervisor where you can be open and honest about your struggles. Explain that you’re feeling consistently stressed at work, and that you don’t know which steps to take. Your employer may be able to offer suggestions or advice to help you better manage your schedule.\n\nIf you’re assigned to a task that’s causing you a lot of stress, your employer may be able to reassign you.\nYour employer may point you towards an employee assistance program (EAP), which may be able to offer counseling and advice. Even if there isn’t an EAP, your workplace may have some resources that you can take advantage of.\n13. Take a few days off if you feel really burnt out.: Meet briefly with your supervisor and see if you can take a long weekend, or if you can have a couple days off to relax and center yourself. Sometimes, the best way to manage stress is to take a step back altogether.\n\nFatigue, regular headaches, changing appetite, and poor immunity are all signs of burnout.\n\nIf you have vacation or personal days saved, you may want to use those to take care of your mental health.\nRemember—there’s nothing wrong with taking time to care for your own needs! If you aren’t feeling your best, you likely won’t perform your best, either.\n14. Write down your biggest stressors in a journal.: Set aside some time each day after work to think about any events that stressed you out. Jot down exactly what happened, along with how you responded to the stress. After a few days or weeks, go through the entries and see if you notice any patterns in your behavior, like the location of the stressor or how you reacted.\n\nFor instance, you may have a tendency to raise your voice during a conflict, or you may leave the room altogether.\nWrite something like: “I got into a disagreement with a co-worker that wasn’t really resolved. I didn’t raise my voice but instead went back to my work area, but I still felt stressed after the fact.”\n15. Exercise for 30 minutes after work to help get rid of some tension.: Run, jog, bike, swim, or do another physical activity for at least a half hour, which can help lower your stress levels and improve your mood. If you have a busy schedule, try dividing your exercise into 10- or 15-minute chunks that you can sprinkle throughout the day.\nFor instance, you can go for a 30-minute walk after work, or you can go for a 10-minute power walk 3 times during the day.\n16. Unwind with some high-quality “me-time.”: Think about activities that make you happy, like fishing, going to the beach, or reading a book. Give yourself time before bed to do this activity, which can help you relax and relieve some leftover stress. Set aside at least 2 days of the week for “me-time,” which can give you something to look forward to.\nFor instance, you can reward yourself with a trip to a local beach or park after work, which can help you unwind.\n17. Get 8 hours of sleep each night to stay refreshed.: Go to bed at a consistent time each night. Ideally, try to get 8 hours of sleep on average each night, which helps you feel refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning.\nIf you go to work well-rested, you’ll feel more refreshed, productive, and able to manage stress throughout the day.\n18. Develop healthy nighttime habits so you get to sleep easily.: Avoid electronics about an hour before you plan on going to sleep. Additionally, refrain from any work or activity that’s mentally intensive. Instead, dim your lights and listen to relaxing music so you can fall asleep easily.\nFor instance, don’t watch TV or use the computer before bed.\n19. Prioritize protein in your diet over sugar to keep your body at its best.: Choose foods in your diet that are high in protein, like lean meats and nuts. Try to cut back on the amount of candy, sugary drinks, and other sweet treats that you enjoy throughout the day. If you eat a lot of junk food, your body won’t be able to handle stress as well.\nFor instance, eat a protein-rich granola bar instead of a candy bar if you’re hungry at work.\n20. Eat foods with a lot of Omega-3 fatty acids to boost your mood.: Reach for foods with high Omega-3 levels, like fatty fish and nuts. Pack salmon or mackerel in your lunch, and snack on a handful of walnuts or flaxseed throughout the day. \nOmega-3 fatty acids can improve your mood, which may help you manage your stress better.\n21. Avoid cigarettes: Think about how often you smoke and drink within a week. Try to cut out as much nicotine from your diet as you can, including cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Additionally, drink alcohol as a weekly treat instead of as a nightly beverage.\n\nNicotine and alcohol can both make you more anxious, which leads to higher stress levels.\nQuitlines and text message programs can help you quit smoking. Additionally, throw out any items that may tempt you to smoke, like lighters or matchbooks.\n"

        "output": "There are several ways in which AI algorithms can be utilized to promote eco-friendly practices in the energy industry. One example is the use of smart grids, which leverage machine learning algorithms to optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions. Smart grids use sensors and data analytics to monitor energy usage in real-time, and then adjust energy distribution and consumption accordingly. This can help reduce energy waste and improve energy efficiency.\nAnother example is the use of intelligent energy management systems, which use machine learning algorithms to analyze energy consumption patterns and optimize energy usage. These systems can identify areas where energy is being wasted and make adjustments to reduce energy consumption. They can also predict energy usage patterns and adjust energy distribution accordingly, helping to reduce carbon emissions.\nScala is a programming language that is well-suited for implementing machine learning algorithms in a cost-effective manner. Scala code can be used to implement algorithms that optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions in the energy industry. For example, Scala can be used to develop algorithms that analyze energy usage data and make recommendations for energy efficiency improvements.\nIn terms of SQL databases, data from energy consumption patterns can be leveraged to train and improve AI algorithms for more effective implementation. SQL code can be used to extract and analyze data from energy consumption patterns, and then use this data to train machine learning algorithms. For example, SQL code can be used to extract data on energy consumption patterns from smart meters, and then use this data to train algorithms that optimize energy usage. \nHere is an example of SQL code that can be used to extract data on energy consumption patterns:\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM energy_consumption_data\nWHERE date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'\n```\nThis code selects all data from the energy_consumption_data table where the date is between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021.

        "instruction": "Given a reference text about Magic the Gathering decks, please suggest cards I should consider in a Midrange deck.",
        "input": "Most classifications of Magic the Gathering decks begin from one of four major strategies: aggro, control, combo and midrange.\n\nAggro\nAggro (short for \"aggressive\") decks attempt to reduce their opponents from 20 life to 0 life as quickly as possible, rather than emphasize a long-term game plan. Aggro decks focus on converting their cards into damage; they prefer to engage in a race for tempo rather than a card advantage-based attrition war. Aggro generally relies upon creatures as its accumulative source of damage. Aggro decks can quickly overwhelm unprepared opponents and proceed to eke out the last bit of damage they need to end the game. Aggro decks also generally have access to disruptive elements, which can inhibit the opponent's attempts to respond.\n\nExample cards: Savannah Lions, Bitterblossom, Lightning Bolt, Rogue Elephant, Incinerate\nExample decks:\nWhite Weenie, which uses small, efficient creatures such as Savannah Lions, Icatian Javelineers, and Mother of Runes\nAffinity, which uses the affinity mechanic and large numbers of artifacts to quickly play spells such as Thoughtcast and Frogmite, while efficiently dealing damage using Disciple of the Vault and Arcbound Ravager.\nZoo, which uses low-cost, high power creatures such as Tarmogoyf and Wild Nacatl to kill the opponent quickly.\nSligh, which utilizes its mana as efficiently as possible to kill the opponent quickly, using low-cost cards such as Jackal Pup and Lightning Bolt.\nSuicide Black, which uses efficient but dangerous cards that cost life such as Thoughtseize, Dark Confidant, Grim Tutor, and Bitterblossom. Suicide Black epitomizes Black's philosophy—win at all costs—and treats even its life total as an expendable resource.\nControl\nControl decks avoid racing. They attempt to slow the game down by executing an attrition plan. As the game progresses, control decks are able to take advantage of their slower, more powerful, cards. The primary strength of control decks is their ability to devalue the opponent’s cards. They do this in four ways:\n\nAnswering threats at a reduced cost. Given the opportunity, Control decks can gain card advantage by answering multiple threats with one spell (\"clearing\"/\"wiping\" the board), stopping expensive threats with cheaper spells, and drawing multiple cards or forcing the opponent to discard multiple cards with one spell.\nNot playing threats to be answered. By playing few proactive spells of their own, control decks gain virtual card advantage by reducing the usefulness of opposing removal cards.\nDisrupting synergies. Even if control decks do not deal with every threat directly, they can leave out whichever ones stand poorly on their own; e.g., an enchantment which gives a bonus to creatures will never need attention if all enemy creatures are quickly neutralized.\nDragging the game out past opposing preparations. An opponent's faster, efficient cards will become less effective over time.\nExample cards: Force of Will, Duress, Wrath of God, Pernicious Deed, Void\nExample decks:\nTezzeret Control, which controls the game using counterspells such as Mana Drain, builds card advantage with cards such as Dark Confidant, and ends the game using Tezzeret the Seeker to find Time Vault and activate it for infinite turns.\nMono Blue Control, which uses a heavy suite of counterspells alongside card-drawing such as Thirst for Knowledge, removal such as Echoing Truth, and a win condition such as Tezzeret the Seeker. This class of deck is nicknamed \"Draw-Go,\" because most of its players' spells are instants designed to be played during his or her opponents' turns.\nBlue-White Control, which is similar to Mono-Blue Control, but features more board-control cards such as Wrath of God, and Pacifism.\nPsychatog, supplemented by card-drawing like Fact or Fiction and a number of disruptive spells.\nAstral Slide, which uses large numbers of cards with cycling, including those with added benefits such as Eternal Dragon and Slice and Dice, to power Astral Slide and Lightning Rift.\nMono-Black Control, which uses removal spells such as Innocent Blood and Barter in Blood to control the board, and Cabal Coffers to kill the opponent with spells such as Consume Spirit. It can also use cards like Underworld Dreams to put the opponent on a timer.\nThe Deck, which uses card drawing such as Fact or Fiction and deck searching cards such as Demonic Tutor to find powerful cards that are highly effective against particular strategies (such as The Abyss, Diabolic Edict, and Balance), alongside a Blue base of counterspells to control the game and obtain an insurmountable lead.\nCombo\nCombo decks use the interaction of two or more cards (a \"combination\") to create a powerful effect that either wins the game immediately or creates a situation that subsequently leads to a win. Combo decks value consistency, speed, and resilience: the deck should be reliable enough to produce the combo on a regular basis, the deck should be able to use the combo fast enough to win before the opponent, and the deck should be able to withstand disruption and still win.\n\nMany decks have smaller, combo-like interactions between their cards, which is better described as synergy.\n\nExample cards: Flash, Tendrils of Agony, Empty the Warrens, Aluren, Painter's Servant.\nExample decks:\nThe Perfect Storm, which utilizes Dark Ritual and artifact mana to draw cards and fuel a lethal Tendrils of Agony, all the while disrupting the opponent with Duress and Force of Will.\nPainter Combo, which uses Painter's Servant and chooses Blue to permit Red Elemental Blast to destroy any permanent or counter any spell, while also allowing Grindstone to put the opponent's entire library into their graveyard.\nWorldgorger Dragon Combo, which revolves around the infinite loop triggered when Worldgorger Dragon is animated from the graveyard using an enchantment such as Animate Dead. The loop generates mana and card drawing which is then used to end the game.\nBelcher Combo, which uses free and efficient mana acceleration to play and activate Goblin Charbelcher, preferably on the first turn. Because the deck has two or fewer lands, one activation of Goblin Charbelcher will almost always kill the opponent.\nHulk-Flash, which is dedicated to casting Flash and putting a Protean Hulk into play and then into the graveyard, allowing the player to find a combination of creatures which will kill the opponent instantly. Summoner's Pact and Merchant Scroll are used to find the combo pieces, while Force of Will and Pact of Negation protect the combo.\nSteel City Vault, which uses \"Draw 7\" spells such as Timetwister to rapidly assemble the Time Vault-Voltaic Key combo for infinite turns. The deck also uses several cards such as Force of Will and Ancient Grudge to efficiently deal with Null Rod, the most effective answer to the Vault-Key combo.\nHexmage Depths, which uses Vampire Hexmage to inexpensively remove the counters from Dark Depths and put a flying, indestructible 20/20 creature token into play as early as the first turn.\nMidrange\nA typical midrange deck has an early game plan of mana ramp and control, but begins to play threats once it reaches four to six mana. A midrange deck will often seek to play a reactive, attrition-based game against aggro decks and a more proactive, tempo-based game against control decks. Colloquially, this is referred to as \"going bigger\" than aggro and \"getting in under\" control.\n\nExample cards: Huntmaster of the Fells Thragtusk, Sakura-Tribe Elder\nExample decks:\nJund Midrange (BRG), a powerful and flexible deck with virtually zero bad matchups thanks to the access of the most powerful cards that each color can offer: black gives Liliana of the Veil and powerful discard cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, red a reliable removal in Lightning Bolt and the green some of the best creatures like Tarmogoyf and Scavenging Ooze.\nAbzan Midrange (WBG), which is similar to Jund, but trades speed for powerful white based cards like Path to Exile, Lingering Souls and Siege Rhino.\nJeskai Midrange (UWR), which has more control elements, using Sphinx's Revelation to draw into a very large number of cards and Assemble the Legion to end up swarming the board with tokens.\nTemur Emerge (GUR), which leverages the Emerge mechanic introduced in Eldritch Moon to efficiently use ramp creatures such as Pilgrim's Eye and Primal Druid for their land-smoothing abilities while sacrificing them to Emerge board-stalling threats such as Elder Deep-Fiend as early as turn 4, also filling the graveyard to make Emrakul, the Promised End playable on turn 7.\nTron, which tries to build the triplet of lands known as \"Urzatron\" (Urza's Tower, Urza's Mine and Urza's Power Plant) as quickly as possible and then uses the massive amount of mana to play powerful cards like Karn Liberated and Wurmcoil Engine as early as turn 3.",

Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. \n\nSo, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard."

        "output": "One potential futuristic energy source that has been proposed is the use of space-based solar power (SBSP).

It also has the potential to completely replace fossil fuels as it can provide a constant stream of energy without the need for any fuel or emissions. \nIn terms of effectiveness, SBSP has several advantages over existing renewable energy sources. Firstly, it can provide energy 24/7, unlike solar and wind power which are dependent on weather conditions. Secondly, it has a much higher energy density than other renewable sources, meaning that it can generate more power per unit of area. Thirdly, it does not require any land usage on Earth, which is a major concern for other renewable sources such as wind turbines and solar farms. \nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to SBSP. Firstly, the initial cost of building and launching the necessary infrastructure into space would be extremely high. Secondly, there are concerns about the safety of transmitting microwave or laser beams to Earth, as well as the potential impact on wildlife and human health. Lastly, the technology for SBSP is still in its infancy and requires further research and development before it can be implemented on a large scale. \nIn terms of availability, scalability, cost, and environmental impact, SBSP has the potential to be a game-changing energy source. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and limitations before making any significant investments in this technology."

It is the state's primate city both in area and population and is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011 Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous urban agglomeration. The Greater Chennai Corporation is the civic body responsible for the city; it is the oldest city corporation of India, established in 1688—the second oldest in the world after London.\n\nHistorically, Chennai and surroundings were part of the Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms for many centuries. The coastal land, which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the British East India Company from the Nayak ruler Damarla Chennapa Nayaka, in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and port, and built Fort St. George—the first British fortress in India—which the French won over briefly in 1746, before becoming the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained its independence in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996.\n\nThe city is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area,[note 1] the 36th-largest urban area in the world by population and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. As the traditional and de facto gateway of South India, Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities by foreigners. It was ranked the 43rd most-visited city in the world in 2015 and 36th in 2019. The Quality of Living Survey rates it as India's safest city. Chennai attracts 45 percent of health tourists visiting India, and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists. As such, it is termed \"India's health capital\". Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy, and had the third-largest expatriate population in India.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Sure, I can help you with that. To find the equation of a line that passes through a given point and has a specific slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\nwhere (x1, y1) is the given point and m is the slope.\nIn this case, we know that the line passes through the point (3, 4) and we need to find its slope. Let's assume that the slope is represented by the variable m. Then, we can write the equation of the line as:\ny - 4 = m(x - 3)\nNow, we need to use the fact that the line passes through the point (3, 4) to solve for the value of m. Substituting x=3 and y=4 into the equation, we get:\n4 - 4 = m(3 - 3)\n0 = 0\nThis equation is true for any value of m, which means that the line can have any slope and still pass through the point (3, 4). However, we also need to find the y-intercept of the line, which is represented by the variable b.\nTo do this, we can rearrange the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, which is:\ny = mx + b\nTo get this form, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation and simplify. Starting with the point-slope form we derived earlier, we have:\ny - 4 = m(x - 3)\ny = mx - 3m + 4\nNow, we can see that the y-intercept is 4 - 3m. This means that we need to solve for the value of m that makes the line pass through the point (3, 4) and have a y-intercept of 4.\nSubstituting x=0 and y=4 into the equation, we get:\n4 = m(0) - 3m + 4\n0 = -3m\nm = 0\nTherefore, the equation of the line that passes through the point (3, 4) and has a y-intercept of 4 is:\ny = 0x + 4\nor simply:\ny = 4\nThis is a horizontal line that passes through the point (3, 4) and has a slope of 0."

So the important thing is ensuring that the Retrospective takes place, and kept on track towards its outputs (the improvement activities).\nOnce you have the improvement activities agreed, then the Scrum Master can be monitoring the agreed metric, and checking that the improvement activity is actually happening.  This can involve reminding team members of what they agreed to do in the meeting; I find it helpful to have the list of improvement actions visible in the stand-up area, so that we are all reminded of them every day, and can have a quick check of our progress towards them as well as to our sprint goals.",

It also tells you where people are open to improvement so you can focus your efforts there.\nAfter this, I recommend creating a regular cadence of coaching and improvement. For a scrum team, the sprint cycle works well with the retro at the end of it. Each retro should have 1 (or 2 tops) action item. It isn't required, but I always recommend that an action item specifies the thing that's happening that is either challenging and they want to improve or good and they want to capitalize on; what the action item is; how they think it will improve the situation; and how they will measure that improvement. \nAnd now you have measurable improvement...\nYou don't have to stop here. You can also build a coaching wall (pull your fellow Scrum Masters into this). Over 5 or 6 weeks, keep a running set of notes on what you're helping your team with. This builds a narrative of how you've helped the team improve. If you do it with other Scrum Masters and teams, you can also pick up on common trends across the organization."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Has a cute boy in middle school caught your eye? Asking someone out is nerve-wracking, but there are some things you can do to make it easier. First get to know your crush, and then move on to flirting. You can ask them out in person if you’re feeling brave, or with a text message if that feels easier.\n1. Talk to him casually about what he’s interested in.: Ask him about any books, movies, or music that he likes—maybe you’ll find something you have in common. You can also just chat about the classes you have together. Finding a mutual interest can help you form a connection.\n\nTry asking: “Do you play any sports?” or  “What’s your favorite movie?”\nStart up a conversation in the hallway between classes or after school.\nTry some playful flirting to build a connection with him and make him smile.\n2. Find out if he’s available.: If he’s already dating someone, or not interested in people of your gender, you can save yourself a lot of trouble by just being friends. If you’re not sure if he’s in a relationship, try checking social media or asking your friends.\n\nTry asking your friends or his friends, “Do you know if he’s dating anyone?” This will make it pretty obvious you’re interested in him, so be prepared for that.\nYou can also ask him directly, if you’re feeling bold: “Are you single?”\n3. Text or message online to get to know him better.: Texting is a good way to flirt with someone, because you’ll probably be less nervous than when you’re talking in person. You can send him memes that made you think of him or talk about your day. If you have contact with him outside of school, it will let him know you are interested in getting to know him better.\n\nShare a song you like or a funny meme.\nTry not to send too many text messages at once, and instead wait for him to respond.\n4. Decide if you want to date him.: Dating in middle school can mean many different things. It might mean you hang out with him with groups of people, you him text a lot, you eat lunch together, or that you hang out outside of school. There’s no one right way to date! It also might depend on how your parents feel about you dating.\nIf your parents don’t want you to date, try explaining that you will just hang out with him in groups, or that you will be back by a certain time.\n5. Pick the right time and place.: Try to ask him out when he’s alone and not surrounded by friends. This will reduce the pressure on both of you, so it’s not a big public moment. If you don’t want to ask him in person, message him after school.\nIt’s probably better not to message at some weird time like 3 in the morning.\n6. Plan what you are going to say ahead of time.: It can be stressful in the moment, so if you’ve planned what you want to say specifically, there’s less chance you’ll chicken out. It’s best to include a time in your question, instead of a vague, “do you want to hang out sometime?”\n\nTry to be direct to avoid confusion: “You seem really cool. Want to go out this weekend?”\nYou can also ask him to a specific activity: “Want to hang out after school sometime this week?” “Want to go get ice cream on Friday?”\nTry to avoid asking him to the movies for a first date, because you won’t be able to talk very much in the theatre. A dinner date might also be too much pressure.\n7. Give yourself a pep talk.: It’s okay to be nervous when you’re asking him out. It’s actually a good sign, because it means you really like him. If you’re feeling scared, ask your friends for support. Write down 5 qualities about yourself that you admire. It might help to give yourself a deadline to ask him out, so you don’t keep putting it off forever.\nPractice giving yourself affirmations like, “You can do it!”\n8. Ask him in person, when there aren’t too many people around.: Remember to smile and make eye contact. Start by saying hi and a casual question, like “how’s your day going?” Then move on to asking him out. If you chicken out the first time you try, just try again!\nRemember, you’ll never know if he wants to go out if you don’t ask.\n9. Ask him out with a text or a note if you’re feeling shy.: Write the note ahead of time and fold it up. Give him the note directly, instead of passing it to him in class with a lot of people in between. You don’t want the whole class to read your note!\nKeep it short and simple. There’s no need to write a whole love letter at this point.\n10. Be prepared for a yes or a no.: If he says that he’s busy, but suggests another time to meet, then that probably means he’s interested. But if he says no, respect his decision. It doesn’t feel good to be rejected, but it’s something that everyone experiences in life, and it doesn’t say anything bad about you.\n\nKeep your response really casual and chill if he's not interested. You could say, \"Oh, well, that's a bummer. Good chatting with you, though.\" and leave it at that.\nIt’s okay to be sad if asking someone out doesn’t work. Try talking to your friends about it and doing some activity that you love to take your mind off it.\n"

        "output": "Email and telephone are two common communication methods used in business communication. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which method to use depends on the specific context and situation.\nCultural differences can impact the effectiveness of these methods. In some cultures, email may be seen as impersonal and inappropriate for certain types of communication, while in other cultures, it may be preferred over telephone communication. Similarly, in some cultures, telephone communication may be seen as more efficient and personal, while in other cultures, it may be seen as intrusive and disruptive.\nIn terms of legal implications, both email and telephone communication can be subject to legal scrutiny. Emails can be used as evidence in legal proceedings, and telephone conversations can be recorded and used as evidence as well. It is important for businesses to have clear policies and guidelines regarding the use of these communication methods to avoid potential legal issues.\nQuantitatively, the cost-benefit ratio of using email versus telephone can vary depending on the specific situation. In terms of response time, email may be slower than telephone communication, but it allows for asynchronous communication, which can be more convenient for both parties. In terms of productivity, email can be more efficient for certain types of communication, such as sharing documents or providing detailed information. However, for more complex or urgent issues, telephone communication may be more effective. Customer satisfaction may also vary depending on the situation, but in general, customers may prefer telephone communication for more personal or urgent issues, while email may be preferred for less urgent or more routine matters.\nIn terms of security and privacy risks, both email and telephone communication can be vulnerable to hacking, data breaches, and identity theft. Email communication can be intercepted or hacked, and sensitive information can be compromised. Telephone communication can also be vulnerable to eavesdropping or hacking, especially if it is conducted over an unsecured network. It is important for businesses to have strong security measures in place for both email and telephone communication to protect sensitive information.\nIn conclusion, both email and telephone communication have their advantages and disadvantages in business communication. The choice of which method to use depends on the specific context and situation, including cultural differences, legal implications, cost-benefit ratio, and security and privacy risks. It is important for businesses to have clear policies and guidelines regarding the use of these communication methods to ensure effective and secure communication."

The only available\n  indication is whether heating is in progress.\n\n\nIf in an instant moment of time only one of the boilers indicates heating in progress (i.e. the other is in state of no heating), what is more probable - its water is hotter or cooler than the other's, or the chances are equal?",
        "output": "Answer:\n\n\n   More likely to be hotter\n\n\nReason:\n\n\n   It's about the temperature curves.  On heating, the temperature rises quickly and almost linearly. The heating involves greater energy than the heat loss, otherwise the boiler would never shut off. The other boiler is cooling down from T2 to T1. The rate of heat loss is proportional to the change in temperature, that is from the current temperature between T2 and T1, and the ambient temperature. Therefore the loss is quicker at T2 than T1, meaning there is a curve, steeper at T2 than at T1, and therefore spends more time below the half-way point.\n\n\nAdditional arm-waving:\n\n\n   I'm going to stick with hysteresis, with the total heating time shorter than the total cooling time. With linear heating and cooling there would be 50% chance of hotter/cooler. But the non-linearity has less effect on heating than cooling. Unfortunately I'm not having the easiest time describing this."

Through physical activity, children can build strength, endurance, and focus, which can lead to better academic performance. Regular exercise can also reduce behaviour problems and stress levels, while promoting good mental habits.\n\nPhysical education also helps to foster team spirit and co-operation, while giving children an appreciation for different sports and the values of fair play and sportsmanship. The physical aspect of physical education can also inspire a sense of teamwork and community, as children learn to interact and cooperate with their peers.\n\nIn conclusion, physical education is an extremely important part of a child’s education. Through physical education, children not only learn about healthy habits and teamwork, but also build confidence and self-esteem. Through physical exercise, children can learn to appreciate the importance of exercise and physical activity, and can gain lifelong benefits such as better physical and mental health, as well as improved academic performance."

        "input": "",
        "output": "I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes. Stereotypes render datasets biased, which in turns bias the algorithms: given the goal to maximize prediction accuracy, the model learns the “patterns” in the dataset and absorbs the socially constructed differences as a part of its prediction algorithm. Can we blame the algorithm? – After all, the model is constrained to the “history” and has no imaginative capacity for the potential of the historically discriminated groups. Essentially we have a “garbage in, garbage out” scenario caused by the historical and representation biases in the data inputs.\n\nOn the other hand, I argue that the outcome differences still constitute an algorithmic bias. I believe that we could still “blame” the model for the objectives and constraints that it has to fulfill (even though we humans lay them down in the first place). As illustrated above, with accuracy as the evaluation metric, the entire prediction/forecast algorithm built on historical datasets is meant to repeat the history without looking for potential or discerning social norms. Does the objective of maximizing accuracy constitute a bias itself? – If we can discern the vicious cycle that is both created by and reifying the socially crafted myths (weak women, reckless youth, and xenophobia), a model that actively learns and propagates certain kinds of societal stereotype should certainly be called out for its bias! However, we hard-wire the models to optimize those goals, and to address the inherent bias in the metrics, we humans are responsible for modifying the objectives and adding appropriate constraints. For example, in the programming assignment we encounter the mitigation technique that rejects predictions within a certain decision boundary. Besides techniques like active rejection, can we add constraints such as promoting the growth of underprivileged groups as an objective? Without these constraints, I would say the outcome differences also constitute an algorithmic bias in the part of objective specification."

By integrating this knowledge into AI models, they can be trained to understand and respect cultural norms and values.\n2. Natural language processing (NLP): NLP models can be trained to recognize and interpret cultural nuances in language. For example, they can be trained to understand idiomatic expressions and cultural references that may be specific to a particular culture.\n3. Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis models can be trained to recognize and interpret emotions and attitudes that are specific to different cultures. This can help AI systems to respond appropriately to cultural cues and avoid misunderstandings.\n4. Machine learning: Machine learning algorithms can be trained on data sets that are specific to different cultural contexts. By doing so, they can learn to produce solutions that are tailored to the specific needs and values of different cultures.\n5. Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to train AI systems to adapt to different cultural contexts over time. By providing feedback and rewards based on cultural appropriateness, these algorithms can help AI systems to learn and improve their performance in different cultural contexts.\nThese are just a few examples of the types of AI models that can be used to learn and adapt to different cultural contexts.

Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, totaling US$394.3 billion in 2022. As of March 2023, Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization. As of June 2022, Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (known for Google), Amazon, Meta (known for Facebook), and Microsoft.\n\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020, and $3 trillion in January 2022. As of January 2023, it was valued at around $2.2 trillion. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.",

These rocks last a long, long time..., Review_2: This does indeed work and if you are not a heavy perspirer it will be effective for several days. Don't know for sure how long it will last as I've not had mine that long, but for sure it's cheaper than the stuff we've been using for years., Review_3: This stuff WORKS. It is slippery and difficult to hold on to when it is wet, so I wasn't surprised when I dropped it on the floor and broke it into four jagged pieces. I'll buy the stick next time., Review_4: I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of crystal deodorants. I am very pleased with the results! This works better than any deodorant I have ever used. I will never go back to traditional deodorants. This was money well spent., Review_5: I was somewhat skeptical at first in hearing about this product, but now I'm a believer. I purchased a crystal a year ago and it is still working. A little water activates the rock and then you apply it like a regular stick deodorant. I can't believe it works so well and lasts so long., Review_6: The product is fantastic, I would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers with excessive persperation issues or B.O. It will eliminate both after a few days use. No kidding. However don't buy from this seller, mine arrived broken completely in half and I contacted the seller for a replacement and they would not return my calls., Review_7: I love this product! I use it and it doesn't make me smell like cologne or perfume but it keeps me smelling good (like me!) all day. It does not irritate my skin and it does the job. It also lasts so much longer than the stick deodorant I used to use. Better product for less money! A real find!, Review_8: I have been using this product for over 10 years. It works much better than common over the counter deodorants and lasts much longer. I have never had a odor issue using this product no matter how hot or sweaty I got.

It should be soft enough to poke through with a fork. Discard the water. Smash the cooked ground root until an even paste is formed. For a smoother paste, use a food processor or blender. Incorporate the sugar while the paste is still hot. Set aside. Add your boba to a pot of boiling water. Add 2 teaspoon of sugar and allow this boil for 5-7 minutes. Once the boba begin to float these are done. Adjust the timing depending on how firm or soft you prefer them. Remove from hot water and set them aside. Brew the ceylon and let this mix well with fresh ground root paste and condensed milk. Finally, add the milk and tapioca pearls to the mixture. Serve the taro milk tea hot or cold.\n\n\nSweet Potato Pie\n\nIngredients\n3 medium sweet potatoes, baked\n1/2 cup butter\n1 cup granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 large eggs beaten\n1/2 cup milk, whole or evaporated\n1 (9-inch) unbaked pie crust\nOptional Toppings\nwhipped cream\nmarshmallow fluff\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 400º F. Scrub the sweet potatoes until clean, prick them 4 to 5 times with a fork. Place onto a baking sheet and bake for 45 - 50 minutes until the sweet potatoes are tender when pricked with a toothpick. Remove from the oven and allow to cool until they can easily be handled. Peel the skin from the sweet potatoes and place the sweet potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Reduce the oven heat to 350º F.\nAdd butter to the sweet potatoes and mash until smooth. Add the sugar(s) to the sweet potatoes and mix until well combined. Add the vanilla extract, milk, and the eggs. Mix until well combined. Pour into the unbaked pie crust.\nBake the pie until the center of the pie is set, about 1 hour. Remove the pie from the oven and allow to cool slightly.\nServe the pie warm or allow to cool before slicing. Top with whipped cream (or your favorite topping) and serve.\n\n\nGnocchi\n\nIngredients\n2 potatoes, peeled\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 egg\n\nInstructions\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.\nCombine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long \"snakes\". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.\n\n\nPotato Latkes\n\nIngredients\n2 1/2 pounds baking potatoes, coarsely shredded \n1 medium onion, coarsely shredded \n2 large eggs, beaten\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\nVegetable oil, for frying\nApplesauce, sour cream, smoked salmon and salmon roe, for serving\n\nInstructions\nIn a colander set over a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the onion and squeeze dry. Let the potatoes and onion drain for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour off the liquid in the bowl, leaving the starchy paste at the bottom. Add the potatoes and onion, along with the eggs, salt, pepper and mix well.\n\nIn a large skillet, heat an 1/8-inch layer of oil until shimmering. Spoon 1/4-cup mounds of the latke batter into the skillet about 2 inches apart and flatten slightly with a spatula. Fry the latkes over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the latkes to paper towels to drain, then transfer to a platter. Repeat to make the remaining latkes, adding more oil to the skillet as needed. \nServe with applesauce, sour cream, smoked salmon and salmon roe.\n\n\nPoutine\n\nIngredients\n3 or 4 large russet potatoes ( 3 to 4 pounds total), peeled and cut into 1/3-inch-wide sticks\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme\nFreshly cracked black pepper\n4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n½ teaspoon onion powder\n1 cup chicken broth\n1 cup beef broth\n1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n1 teaspoon Better Than Bouillon beef base or 1 beef bouillon cube\n1 teaspoon unfiltered apple cider vinegar\n10 ounces white cheddar cheese curds, at room temperature\nMinced fresh parsley\n\nInstructions\nMake the fries. Place the batons in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Let soak for at least 30 minutes up to 24 hours for crispier fries.\nPreheat the oven to 425°F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.\nSpread the potatoes out onto large, clean kitchen towels. Dry them off as best as possible. Place the potatoes on the prepared baking sheets, drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with the thyme and salt and add black pepper to taste. Toss to coat evenly, then spread out the potatoes into a single layer.\nBake for 10 minutes, then toss the fries and rotate the pans, swapping the one on the top for the one on the bottom. Increase the oven to 450°F and bake the fries for 10 minutes more.Toss the fries and swap the pans from top to bottom again. Turn on the broiler and cook the fries until they are beginning to brown and crisp, about 5 more minutes. Continue to toss and broil until the fries reach your desired doneness. Season with salt and pepper.\nMeanwhile, make the gravy. In a large saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle the flour over the butter and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic powder and onion powder. Slowly add the chicken and beef broth. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened. Stir in the Worcestershire, beef bouillon, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.\nTo assemble the poutine, divide the fries among 4 plates. Sprinkle it with the cheese curds, drizzle on the gravy, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately."

        "input": "Dynamite!! 2010 was a mixed martial arts and kickboxing event in the annual New Year's Eve event promoted by Fighting and Entertainment Group that took place on December 31, 2010 at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. The event included bouts that encompass the DREAM, K-1 and K-1 World MAX banners. Just as the previous Dynamite!! 2009, with the official commentator Nozomi Sasaki, the event aired on TBS in Japan and HDNet in North America.\n\nBackground\nFEG president Tanikawa had stated that the company planned on holding an event together with Sengoku Raiden Championship and this event may have a similar DREAM vs SRC format as Dynamite!! 2009. However, this did not happen as SRC held its own event, World Victory Road Presents: Soul of Fight.\n\nTanikawa has also stated that this Dynamite!! event will most likely be shortened (to around three hours) and the annual K-1 Koshien tournament will not take place at this event.\n\nThe title fight between Bibiano Fernandes and Hiroyuki Takaya was the last in the 63 kg. (139 lbs) weight class before it gets broken into the standard MMA bantamweight and featherweight divisions. DREAM plans on holding a Grand Prix in whichever of the two weight classes the champion does not decide to fight in. After winning the title, Hiroyuki Takaya stated that he would become the Featherweight (145 lbs) Champion.\n\nThe Aoki/Nagashima fight was first announced that there would be an alternate of four rounds, with one round under MMA rules and the next round, then they will change gloves and, fight under kickboxing rules. A coin toss will determine what rules they start under. However, it has later announced that the fight will feature one three-minute kickboxing round, followed by a standard five-minute MMA round. The fighters used open-fingered gloves throughout. If no winner were decided in the eight minutes of competition, the fight would have been declared an automatic draw.\n\nA fight between Bob Sapp and Shinichi Suzukawa in a super-heavyweight “IGF rules” bout was set to feature a rule set similar to MMA, but with no closed fist strikes. However, the fight was canceled due to Sapp attempting to re-negotiate his contract backstage prior to the event and eventually electing to withdraw from the contest.",

Finally, propose and justify at least three potential solutions to mitigate the effects of global warming and prevent further damage to the environment and society.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Global warming, also known as climate change, is the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The direct consequences of global warming are widespread and can be devastating for both the environment and society.\nChanges in sea levels are one of the most visible consequences of global warming. As the planet warms, glaciers and ice sheets melt, causing sea levels to rise. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global sea levels have risen by about 15 cm (6 inches) over the past century, and they are projected to rise by another 30-110 cm (1-3.6 feet) by the end of this century. This rise in sea levels can cause flooding, erosion of coastlines, and the displacement of coastal communities.\nExtreme weather events are another consequence of global warming. As the planet warms, it creates more energy in the atmosphere, leading to more frequent and intense heat waves, droughts, and wildfires. Additionally, warmer oceans can lead to more powerful hurricanes and typhoons. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the number of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the United States has increased from an average of 6.2 events per year in the 1980s to 16.3 events per year in the 2010s.\nBiodiversity loss is another consequence of global warming. As temperatures rise, many species are forced to migrate to cooler areas or face extinction. According to a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), global populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have declined by an average of 68% since 1970.\nGlobal warming also has a significant impact on human health. Heat waves and air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can lead to respiratory problems, heart attacks, and strokes. Additionally, the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever is linked to warmer temperatures.\nThe consequences of global warming are not evenly distributed around the world. Developing nations, which often have fewer resources to adapt to the effects of climate change, are likely to be hit the hardest. For example, according to the IPCC, many small island nations are at risk of being completely submerged by rising sea levels. Additionally, many developing countries rely heavily on agriculture, which is vulnerable to droughts and other extreme weather events.\nTo mitigate the effects of global warming, several solutions have been proposed. One potential solution is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Another solution is to increase energy efficiency by improving building insulation and using more efficient appliances. Additionally, reforestation and afforestation can help to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, global warming has a wide range of direct consequences, including changes in sea levels, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and impacts on human health. These consequences are not evenly distributed around the world, with developing nations likely to be hit the hardest. To mitigate the effects of global warming, several solutions have been proposed, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and reforestation."

A rally is won when the ball hits the ground on the opponent's side of the court, or when the opponent fails to return the ball over the net. The first team to score 25 points and have a two-point lead wins the set. A match is typically played in a best-of-five sets format.\nRegulations related to rotations or positions:\nPlayers must rotate clockwise after each serve, meaning that each player must take a turn serving and playing in each of the six positions on the court. Additionally, players must adhere to specific rules regarding where they can stand on the court during certain situations, such as serving or blocking.\nPopular tactics or strategies:\nSome common tactics used in volleyball include serving aggressively to force the opponent out of system, using quick sets to exploit holes in the opponent's defense, and running a variety of offensive plays to keep the opponent guessing.\nRole and responsibilities of the referee:\nThe referee is responsible for ensuring that the game is played according to the rules and regulations of the sport. They make calls on violations such as double hits, net touches, and foot faults. They also signal when a ball is in or out of bounds, and can overrule line judges if necessary.\nOverall, volleyball is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires a combination of skill, strategy, and teamwork.

They had no concept of joy, love, anger, or even sadness. \nThe Emotionless lived in a highly advanced society where everything was governed by logic and reason. They had created a utopian world where there was no conflict, no war, and no suffering. However, this came at a great cost. The Emotionless lacked the ability to form meaningful relationships with one another. They had no friends, no family, and no romantic partners. They were all alone in a world that was devoid of any emotional connection.\nOne day, a young Emotionless named Xander began to question the nature of his existence. He wondered why he felt so disconnected from the world around him. He longed to experience the emotions that he had heard so much about. Xander began to explore his world, seeking out anything that might elicit an emotional response. He watched the sunset, listened to music, and even tried eating different foods, but nothing seemed to work.\nXander's quest for emotions led him to a group of rebels who believed that the Emotionless were being oppressed by their government. They believed that emotions were a fundamental part of human nature and that the Emotionless were being denied their basic rights. Xander was hesitant to join the rebels at first, but he was desperate to feel something, anything.\nAs Xander became more involved with the rebels, he began to discover a world that he never knew existed. He formed close friendships with his fellow rebels, and even fell in love with a young woman named Ava. For the first time in his life, Xander felt a sense of purpose and belonging.\nHowever, the government soon caught wind of the rebels' activities and began to crack down on them. Xander and his friends were forced to go into hiding, but they continued to fight for their right to feel emotions. Eventually, they were able to overthrow the government and establish a new society where emotions were celebrated and cherished.\nIn the end, Xander realized that emotions were not just a luxury, but a necessity for a fulfilling life. He was grateful for the experiences he had with the rebels, but he was also excited to explore the world of emotions on his own. The Emotionless civilization was forever changed, and the people were finally able to experience the full range of human emotion."

However, you cannot use loops or recursion. Instead, you must use a single line of code that involves only basic arithmetic operations and the input parameter. The function should return the factorial as an integer.\nHere is an example of what the code should look like:\npublic static int Factorial(int n)\n{\n    return Enumerable.Range(1, n).Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);\n}\nCan you explain how this code works, and suggest any further optimizations or alternative solutions?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Yes, I can help you with that!\nThe code you provided is using the Enumerable.Range method to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, and then using the Aggregate method to apply a function to each pair of numbers in the sequence, multiplying them together to calculate the factorial.\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:\n1. The Enumerable.Range method generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to n.\n2. The Aggregate method applies a function to each pair of numbers in the sequence, multiplying them together.\n3. The result of each multiplication is used as the first parameter (a) in the next multiplication, until all the numbers in the sequence have been multiplied together.\n4. The final result is returned as the factorial of the input parameter.\nThis code is already quite efficient and concise, but one possible optimization would be to use a tail-recursive function to calculate the factorial. This would avoid the overhead of creating a sequence of numbers and applying a function to each pair, and would instead use a series of nested function calls to calculate the factorial.\nHere's an example of what a tail-recursive factorial function in C# might look like:\npublic static int Factorial(int n, int acc = 1)\n{\n    if (n == 0)\n    {\n        return acc;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return Factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n    }\n}\nThis function takes two parameters: n, which is the input integer, and acc, which is an accumulator that keeps track of the factorial as it is calculated. The function checks if n is equal to 0, and if so, returns the accumulator as the factorial. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with n-1 and n*acc as the new parameters.\nThis tail-recursive function should be more efficient than the original code, since it avoids the overhead of creating a sequence of numbers and applying a function to each pair. However, it may be slightly less readable and harder to understand for someone who is not familiar with tail recursion."

These techniques allow for the detection of specific DNA sequences that are unique to GMOs, making it easier to identify and track them throughout the supply chain.\nOne example of bioengineering being used in supply chain management is the use of DNA barcoding. This involves sequencing a short segment of DNA from a particular species and using it as a unique identifier. DNA barcoding has been used to identify the species of fish in the seafood supply chain and to track the origin of food products.\nHowever, the use of bioengineering in the production and distribution of food raises ethical considerations. Some people are concerned about the potential health and environmental risks associated with GMOs, and others worry about the impact on small farmers and the potential for corporate control of the food supply.\nTo address these concerns, measures are being taken to ensure that consumers are informed and able to make informed decisions about the food they consume. For example, in many countries, food products containing GMOs must be labeled as such. Additionally, there are organizations that provide information and resources to help consumers make informed decisions about the food they buy.\nOverall, while the use of bioengineering in the food supply chain has its benefits, it is important to consider the ethical implications and ensure that consumers have access to accurate information about the food they are consuming."

        "input": "Any object, totally or partially immersed in a fluid or liquid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nArchimedes' principle allows the buoyancy of any floating object partially or fully immersed in a fluid to be calculated. The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes' principle above. Thus, the net force on the object is the difference between the magnitudes of the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant—that is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes' principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body(s).\n\nConsider a cuboid immersed in a fluid, its top and bottom faces orthogonal to the direction of gravity (assumed constant across the cube's stretch). The fluid will exert a normal force on each face, but only the normal forces on top and bottom will contribute to buoyancy. The pressure difference between the bottom and the top face is directly proportional to the height (difference in depth of submersion). Multiplying the pressure difference by the area of a face gives a net force on the cuboid ⁠ ⁠—  the buoyancy ⁠ ⁠—  equaling in size the weight of the fluid displaced by the cuboid. By summing up sufficiently many arbitrarily small cuboids this reasoning may be extended to irregular shapes, and so, whatever the shape of the submerged body, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.\n\n weight of displaced fluid = weight of object in vacuum − weight of object in fluid\n\nThe weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravity.",
        "output": "When you immerse an object under water, it pushes the water away in order to take its place.\nThe water wants to get back to where it was before and pushes the object away, towards the surface.\nThen it depends what is the weight of the object, compared with how much water was moved.\nImagine you could put your object on one side of a balance, and on the other side, you would duplicate your object and transform it into water (representing how much water is moved if you were to plunge put your object under water).\nIf your original object is lighter than its equivalent in water, like a bubble for example, or a balloon, the water will be strong enough to have the object to float.\nIf the object is heavier than its equivalent water, like a bowling ball, or a rock, the water will not be able to push hard enough, and the object will sink."

Somehow, though, web browsers still manage to run multifarious websites and apps, so the idea doesn't seem that preposterous.\nThere are rumors about a \"lean edition\" of Windows 10, but that isn't quite what I'm getting at. That flavor of Windows is intended for low-power, low-storage PCs, and removes advanced and legacy features such as the registry editor and Internet Explorer. I'm talking about making all the latest bells and whistles optional.\nThe macOS situation is no better, and possibly even less flexible. There, Cupertino decides what's best for you. Want a touch screen or a USB-A port on your new laptop? Too bad. Messaging and video calling? You can only use its products.\nLinux and Ubuntu lie at the other end of the spectrum: too much choice and not enough usability.\nMicrosoft actually already has a mechanism that could make this modular system work: the Microsoft Store. The company has struggled to get people and developers to embrace the store, even though it plays a big role in its future aspirations; Windows 10S Mode only runs store apps. Making parts of the OS available in the store would boost its profile.\nA modular approach doesn't work for everything. It's been tried for smartphones and laptops with very little success. But for a piece of software that many would like to run unobtrusively in the background, it could make a lot of sense. Those who like to tinker with all the newest features are free to do so, but let those who just want bare-bones serviceability have that, too."

Mallett, a former chief operating officer (COO) of Yahoo!, who was raised in Victoria, British Columbia, and played for several collegiate soccer teams. He later purchased minority stakes in the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball and English soccer club Derby County F.C. Having first met at a charity soccer event in 2005, Mallett partnered with Steve Nash—a two-time National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player who was also raised in Victoria—to put together a bid for a minority share of English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in 2008. After that transaction fell through, the duo contacted Kerfoot about a minority stake in the club. Nash is the older brother of former Whitecaps midfielder Martin Nash. The fourth partner, Steve Luczo, is the president, chairman, and CEO of Seagate Technology and a partner in Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., a group who own the NBA Boston Celtics. Luczo met Kerfoot while the two were both employed by Seagate Technology, and Kerfoot contacted Luczo proposing he become part of the club's MLS bid.

        "output": "Proof:\nWe start with the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In algebraic terms, if a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then:\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nNow, let's suppose that x and y are two real numbers. We can construct a right triangle with legs of length x and y, and a hypotenuse of length z, as shown in the diagram below:\n```\n   /|\n  / |\n /  |\n/___|\n  x  y\n```\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\nz^2 = x^2 + y^2\nNow, let's manipulate this equation in three different ways to show that x^2 = y^2 for all possible values of x and y.\nMethod 1: Factoring\nWe can factor z^2 - x^2 as (z + x)(z - x). Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n(z + x)(z - x) = y^2\nDividing both sides by (z + x), we get:\nz - x = y^2 / (z + x)\nDividing both sides by (z - x), we get:\n1 = y^2 / ((z + x)(z - x))\nSubstituting z^2 - x^2 for y^2, we get:\n1 = (z^2 - x^2) / ((z + x)(z - x))\nMultiplying both sides by (z + x)(z - x), we get:\nz^2 - x^2 = y^2\nBut we know that z^2 = x^2 + y^2, so substituting this into the equation above, we get:\nx^2 + y^2 - x^2 = y^2\nSimplifying, we get:\ny^2 = y^2\nThis shows that x^2 = y^2 for all possible values of x and y.\nMethod 2: Completing the square\nWe can rewrite z^2 - x^2 as (z + x)(z - x) and substitute this into the equation above to get:\n(z + x)(z - x) = y^2\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\nz^2 - x^2 = y^2\nAdding x^2 to both sides, we get:\nz^2 = x^2 + y^2\nNow, let's complete the square for the left-hand side of this equation. We can write:\nz^2 = (x/2)^2 + y^2 + (x/2)^2\nThis is because (x/2)^2 is half of x^2, and adding it to y^2 gives us the missing square term on the left-hand side. Now, we can rewrite this as:\nz^2 = (x/2)^2 + (y^2 + (x/2)^2)\nBut we know that z^2 = x^2 + y^2, so substituting this into the equation above, we get:\nx^2 + y^2 = (x/2)^2 + (y^2 + (x/2)^2)\nSimplifying, we get:\nx^2 + y^2 = x^2/4 + y^2 + x^2/4\nSubtracting x^2/2 and y^2 from both sides, we get:\nx^2/2 = 0\nThis shows that x^2 = 0, which implies that x = 0 for all possible values of x and y. Substituting this into the original equation, we get:\n0^2 = y^2\nSimplifying, we get:\n0 = y^2\nThis shows that y = 0 for all possible values of x and y. Therefore, x^2 = y^2 for all possible values of x and y.\nMethod 3: Using the quadratic formula\nWe can rewrite z^2 - x^2 as (z + x)(z - x) and substitute this into the equation above to get:\n(z + x)(z - x) = y^2\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\nz^2 - x^2 = y^2\nAdding x^2 to both sides, we get:\nz^2 = x^2 + y^2\nNow, let's use the quadratic formula to solve for z. We have:\nz^2 - x^2 = y^2\nz^2 = x^2 + y^2\nSubstituting these into the quadratic formula, we get:\nz = +/- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nBut we know that z is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length x and y. Therefore, z must be positive, so we can discard the negative solution. This gives us:\nz = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nBut we know that z^2 = x^2 + y^2, so substituting this into the equation above, we get:\nz = sqrt(z^2)\nSquaring both sides, we get:\nz^2 = z^2\nThis shows that x^2 = y^2 for all possible values of x and y.\nTable of values:\n```\nx    y    x^2    y^2    x^2 = y^2\n----------------------------------\n1    1    1      1      Yes\n2    2    4      4      Yes\n3    4    9      16     No\n5    12   25     144    No\n```\nGraph:\n```\n  |\n  |    x=y\n  |   /\n  |  /\n  | /\n  |/\n  +-----+\n         |\n         |\n         |\n         |\n         |\n```\nThe graph above shows that the equation x^2 = y^2 represents a hyperbola with two branches, one in the first and third quadrants, and the other in the second and fourth quadrants. The line x = y is the asymptote of the hyperbola.\nImplications for geometry, trigonometry, and calculus:\nThe equation x^2 = y^2 has important implications for geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. In geometry, it represents the equation of a hyperbola, which is a conic section with many interesting properties. In trigonometry, it is related to the Pythagorean theorem, which is a fundamental theorem that relates the sides of a right triangle. In calculus, it is related to the concept of limits, which is a fundamental concept that underlies many important results in analysis.\nReal-world applications:\nThe equation x^2 = y^2 has many real-world applications in physics, engineering, and other fields. For example, it is used to calculate the distance between two points in three-dimensional space, which is an important problem in many applications. It is also used to calculate the length of the sides of a right triangle, which is important in surveying, navigation, and other fields. Additionally, it is used in many areas of physics, such as optics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics, where it represents the equation of a wave or particle."

        "instruction": "What is the likelihood that Donald Trump's HHS secretary nominee, Alex Azar, will push policies that benefit pharmaceutical companies' pocketbooks?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "His record suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Monday that his nominee for HHS secretary, Alex Azar will “be a star for … lower drug prices!” But the record of the former top executive for Eli Lilly, which tripled the price of a top-selling insulin drug while he led its U.S. operation, suggests a different story.\nLilly is one of three drug companies targeted by a class-action lawsuit that accuses the company, then under Azar’s watch, of exploiting the drug pricing system to ensure higher profit for insulin and has been fined in Mexico for colluding on the pricing of the drug .\nAzar, who spent almost a decade at Eli Lilly, rising to become president of the drug giant’s U.S. operations before leaving earlier this year, doesn’t deny drug costs are a consumer issue. But his record there and as a top official in George W. Bush’s administration suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nIn recent years, Azar has defended pricing practices, and argued against the approaches to reduce costs to consumer s as Trump endorsed during his campaign, such as allowing the government to negotiate drug prices and importing medicines from oversees.\nInstead, Azar has followed the pharma messaging playbook on drug pricing — deflecting attention to other parts of the health system, and even other countries, blaming them for the high drug costs paid by U.S. patients. He’s also justified drug prices as the cost of innovation.\nTrump’s focus on drug pricing in announcing Azar’s nomination didn’t win over doubters, who no longer believe he is serious about going after the industry he once slammed as “getting away with murder.” But it will make it easier for critics to pounce on what will likely be the toughest barrier for Azar to overcome during his confirmation process in the Senate.\nSen. Bernie Sanders said Monday he will “vigorously oppose” the nomination of Azar.\n“During Mr. Azar’s tenure at Eli Lilly, this multi billion-dollar corporation dodged taxes while charging Americans outrageously high prices for life saving prescription drugs,” Sanders said.\nSanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings commenced an investigation into Eli Lilly’s rising prices for insulin last year, spurring attorneys generals in Washington and New Mexico to look into the matter. The lawmakers questioned why the prices of the diabetes medicine whose main patent expired 75 years ago have seen huge jumps in recent years, with competitors often raising prices in tandem. One of Eli Lilly’s insulins, Humulin R U-500, rose 325 percent in price from 2010 to 2015.\nCummings tweeted that picking Azar is “like a fox guarding the hen house,” and a “slap in the face,” to Americans waiting for action on lower drug prices.\nAzar contends the outrage over drug pricing “erupted because we have seen a complete fundamental restructuring of health insurance,” with a shift to high-deductible plans that puts the burden of drug costs on employees and individuals, he said at a conference in May.\nWhile Azar makes a valid point, changing insurance policies without addressing drugmakers’ markups of existing drug prices, or high launch prices for new medicines, “is avoiding the elephant in the room.” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies drug prices at Harvard Medical School.\nEven Azar acknowledged in his speech that if insurance companies reduced consumers’ out of pocket charges for medicines, those costs would show up elsewhere, likely in premium increases.\nAzar has also attacked government regulators and payers for devaluing pharmaceutical innovation, suggesting that if the U.S. cuts pharma profits, it will see decreased investment in new drugs and fewer new cures.\n“The narrow focus of costs of medicine to the exclusion of innovation would be self-defeating in the long run,” Azar said in a 2014 speech.\nSarpatwari worries such views will lead Azar to promote the idea that making it quicker and easier for drug makers to introduce new medicines will reduce pharmaceutical costs. Researchers have found that drug companies don’t price their products any cheaper when FDA lets them use the accelerated approval process or other tactics to speed drugs to market. Former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf recently said that despite claims by the Trump administration that faster drug approvals lead to lower cost drugs, there is no direction relationship between the cost of development and price of drugs.\nNonetheless, in June, Azar told Fox Business that getting more new drugs to market to increase competition among brands would help bring U.S. prices down. Yet there’s only one example the drug industry can point to in the U.S. where brand competition has led to lower prices — and many where competitors simply raise prices in tandem. For example, Democrats recently launched a probe into the rising price of multiple sclerosis drugs where drugs introduced decades ago have raised prices to match their newer competitors.\nAnd while Azar expresses support for competition, one of the major factors keeping generic versions of insulin off the market have been drug company tactics known as evergreening — making incremental tweaks to their insulin versions or the devices that deliver it, to extend their monopolies for decades.\nAn article published in The Lancet in late 2015 found that most of the recent innovation in the insulin market has centered on improvements in delivery devices, blocking generics by agents that are indirectly related to the drug.\nAzar has also opposed other ideas to encourage competitive drug pricing. He’s spoken out against studies known as comparative effectiveness research, used to determine which drugs are most cost-effective for treating patients with a disease. He argues that all options should be available since different patients may need different medicines. The problem however, is that if payers must make all drugs available, they have little leverage to negotiate lower drug prices with industry.\nThe result is that despite Trump’s tweets praising Azar as a champion for lower costs , few fighting for lower drug prices are pinning their hopes on action by Azar.\n“This nominee has impeccable big pharma credentials but non-existent credentials when it comes to concerns on drug prices,” said Peter Welch, co-chair of the House Democrats Drug Pricing Task Force."

        "input": "Multiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics",

        "output": "Sure, I'll be happy to help you with that. \nTo break down the customer churn rate by demographics such as age, gender, and location, we would need access to customer data that includes these variables. Once we have the data, we can use various statistical methods to analyze the churn rate by demographic groups. For example, we can calculate the churn rate for each age group, gender, and location and compare them to identify any significant differences.\nTo predict potential churn based on user behavior and engagement metrics, we can use machine learning algorithms that analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that indicate a high likelihood of churn. These algorithms can take into account factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the types of interactions, and the time spent on the platform. By analyzing these metrics, we can identify customers who are at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.\nTo address identified churn reasons and improve customer retention, we can implement various strategies such as:\n1. Improving the customer experience: By making the platform more user-friendly and addressing pain points, we can improve the overall customer experience and reduce churn.\n2. Offering incentives: Offering discounts, loyalty programs, or other incentives can encourage customers to stay with the platform.\n3. Providing better customer support: By providing responsive and helpful customer support, we can address customer issues and prevent churn.\n4. Personalizing the customer experience: By tailoring the platform to individual customer preferences, we can increase engagement and reduce churn.\n5. Communicating with customers: By regularly communicating with customers and soliciting feedback, we can identify issues and address them before they lead to churn. \nI hope this helps.

The code will include statistical analysis techniques such as regression analysis, time-series analysis, and factor analysis to provide insights into the impact of the global banking crisis on China's macroeconomic indicators.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Certainly, I can provide you with information on all of these topics.\nFirstly, the 2008 global banking crisis had a significant impact on China's macroeconomic indicators. China's GDP growth rate slowed down from 14.2% in 2007 to 9.6% in 2008, and further to 6.6% in 2009. The inflation rate also decreased from 6.5% in 2007 to 5.9% in 2008, and further to 1.4% in 2009. However, the unemployment rate remained relatively stable, increasing only slightly from 4.0% in 2007 to 4.2% in 2009.\nTo address these challenges, China implemented a series of monetary policies and structural reforms. For example, the government increased spending on infrastructure projects to boost domestic demand and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the People's Bank of China lowered interest rates and increased liquidity in the financial system to encourage lending and investment.\nThe impact of China's economic situation on neighboring countries and the global economic landscape is significant due to China's position as the world's second-largest economy. The slowdown in China's economic growth has had a negative impact on commodity prices, which has affected countries that rely on exports of commodities such as Australia and Brazil. Additionally, the decrease in Chinese demand for goods and services has had a negative impact on other countries in the region, such as South Korea and Japan.\nRegarding the long-term effects of these macroeconomic changes on China's social welfare, income distribution, and environmental sustainability, there are both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, the government's focus on infrastructure projects has created jobs and improved access to basic services such as healthcare and education. On the other hand, income inequality has increased, with the gap between the rich and poor widening. Additionally, China's rapid economic growth has had a negative impact on the environment, with pollution and resource depletion becoming major challenges.\nRegarding the data analysis using MATLAB, it is an excellent tool for performing statistical analysis on large datasets. Regression analysis can be used to identify relationships between macroeconomic indicators, while time-series analysis can be used to identify trends and patterns in the data. Factor analysis can be used to identify underlying factors that may be driving changes in the macroeconomic indicators. By using these techniques, you can gain a deeper understanding of the impact of the global banking crisis on China's economy and the subsequent policy responses."

        "output": "There are several methodologies employed by economists to measure economic growth, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Product (GNP), Net National Product (NNP), and Net Domestic Product (NDP).\nGDP is the most commonly used measure of economic growth and is calculated by adding up the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period of time. GNP, on the other hand, measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country's citizens, regardless of where they are located.\nNNP subtracts depreciation from GNP to account for the wear and tear on capital goods, while NDP subtracts depreciation from GDP to account for the wear and tear on a country's infrastructure.\nIn terms of accuracy, reliability, and relevance, GDP is generally considered the most accurate and reliable measure of economic growth, as it provides a comprehensive snapshot of a country's economic activity. However, it does not account for factors such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and the distribution of wealth.\nGNP is less commonly used than GDP, but it can be more relevant for countries with large diaspora populations or significant foreign investment. NNP and NDP are less commonly used than GDP and GNP, but they can provide a more accurate picture of a country's economic growth by accounting for the depreciation of capital goods and infrastructure.\nIn certain situations, certain methods may be more suitable than others. For example, if a country has a large diaspora population that contributes significantly to its economy, GNP may be a more relevant measure of economic growth than GDP. Alternatively, if a country has significant infrastructure investments, NDP may be a more accurate measure of economic growth than GDP. Ultimately, the choice of methodology will depend on the specific circumstances and goals of the analysis."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time. The purpose of machine learning is to enable computers to perform complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually, such as recognizing patterns in large datasets, making predictions, and identifying anomalies.\nThe history of machine learning dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, when researchers first began developing algorithms that could learn from data. However, it wasn't until the 1990s and 2000s that machine learning really began to take off, thanks to the availability of large datasets and improvements in computing power. Today, machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to fraud detection and recommendation systems.\nOne of the most promising applications of machine learning is in healthcare. For example, researchers have developed algorithms that can analyze medical images to detect early signs of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. Machine learning is also being used to develop personalized treatment plans based on a patient's genetic makeup and medical history.\nAnother area where machine learning is having a significant impact is in finance. Banks and other financial institutions are using machine learning algorithms to detect fraud and identify potential risks in real time. These algorithms can analyze large volumes of data and identify patterns that might be missed by human analysts, enabling financial institutions to respond quickly to potential threats.\nA third example of machine learning in action is in the field of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars use machine learning algorithms to analyze data from sensors and cameras to make decisions about how to navigate the road. These algorithms can learn from experience and improve their performance over time, making autonomous vehicles safer and more reliable.\nDespite the many benefits of machine learning, there are also ethical considerations that must be taken into account. For example, there is the risk of bias in machine learning algorithms, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Additionally, there is the question of who is responsible if a machine learning algorithm makes a mistake or causes harm.\nTo address these ethical concerns, researchers are working to develop more transparent and accountable machine learning algorithms. This includes developing methods for auditing algorithms to ensure that they are fair and unbiased, as well as developing systems for tracking and reporting errors and other issues.\nMachine learning is often used interchangeably with other terms such as deep learning and neural networks. While these terms are related, they refer to different aspects of artificial intelligence.\nDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from complex and unstructured data, such as images and natural language. Deep learning algorithms are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information, using layers of artificial neurons to analyze and interpret data.\nNeural networks are a type of deep learning algorithm that are designed to recognize patterns in data. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, each of which performs a simple computation on the input data. By combining these computations across multiple layers, neural networks can learn to recognize complex patterns in data.\nThe distinction between machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks is important because it highlights the different approaches that researchers are taking to develop artificial intelligence. While machine learning algorithms are effective for many tasks, they may not be well-suited for tasks that require more complex reasoning or understanding of context. Deep learning and neural networks are designed to address these limitations, but they also come with their own challenges and limitations.\nIn conclusion, machine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize many industries and improve our lives in countless ways. However, it is important to approach the development and deployment of machine learning algorithms with caution and consideration for the ethical implications. By doing so, we can ensure that machine learning continues to advance in a responsible and beneficial way."

        "output": "What are those diagrams ?\nThey show dependencies between the internal modules of various well-known Python libraries.\nThey goal is to provide a global overview of a Python project architecture, as a map of modules & packages, the top-level code abstractions.\nNote that all module names in those diagrams are HTML links to the actual source code on GitHub.\nAt work, we did a short technical-debt review of one of our Python services, and a co-worker reported a lack of documentation to provide a clear overview of the code structure, for first-time contributors to easily jump in.\nHence, last week I searched for some helpful code visualization recipes to provide such insight to our code base, hoping to find an easy-to-setup Python module that would do the job.\nI did not find any off-the-shelf package for my need (although I'd love your suggestions if you know some !), but discovered Francois Zaninotto's DependencyWheel visualization of dependencies, and decided to use it to build a nice diagram and add it to our documentation.\nI thought it could be useful to others, hence this blog post to share the recipe online.\nFollowing the spirit of \"Modern Technical Writing\" / \"Literate programming\" / \"Living Documentation\", our documentation for this project at work is written in Markdown and compiled with mkdocs to provide a static website. Moreover, the project is built & hosted by GitLab Pages.\nI added some code to the GitLab Pages build script to fetch the corresponding git repo and extract the modules dependencies as JSON.\nThe code is available in this page source. Like the Python script, you are free to reuse it at will.\nIt is relatively straightforward, with a single notable trick: the conversion from a Python module path to a hue color value on a 360 degrees scale.\nIn order for modules with a shared ancestor to have close colors (like http.response.html and http.response.text in the scrapy wheel above), I used a simple mathematical concept: decomposing the hue value with a bijective numeration into a fixed-size string of digits.\nThis idea is similar to the binary numeral system, notably with the same concept of most / least significant digits, except that the final range covered is [0, 360] and we want as many digits as the module tree depth."

Open a new or existing Word document and go to the \"Insert\" tab.\n2. Click on \"Equation\" in the \"Symbols\" section.\n3. In the equation editor, type in the left side of the equation: \\sqrt{\\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{(z^2-t^2)}}.\n4. Next, type in the right side of the equation: \\frac{a}{b}.\n5. To make the equation easier to read, you can add some parentheses around the numerator and denominator of the fraction on the left side of the equation, like this: \\sqrt{\\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{(z^2-t^2)}} = \\frac{(a)}{(b)}.\n6. To solve for x, y, z, and t, you can start by squaring both sides of the equation: \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{(z^2-t^2)}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{(a)}{(b)}\\right)^2.\n7. Simplify the left side of the equation by removing the square root: \\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{(z^2-t^2)} = \\frac{(a^2)}{(b^2)}.\n8. Cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction: (x^2+y^2)*(b^2) = (a^2)*(z^2-t^2).\n9. Expand the left side of the equation: x^2*(b^2) + y^2*(b^2) = (a^2)*(z^2-t^2).\n10. Rearrange the terms to isolate x and y on one side of the equation: x^2*(b^2) = (a^2)*(z^2-t^2) - y^2*(b^2).\n11. Divide both sides of the equation by (b^2): x^2 = \\frac{(a^2)*(z^2-t^2) - y^2*(b^2)}{(b^2)}.\n12. Take the square root of both sides of the equation to isolate x: x = \\sqrt{\\frac{(a^2)*(z^2-t^2) - y^2*(b^2)}{(b^2)}}.\n13. Repeat steps 11 and 12 to solve for y, z, and t.\nI hope this helps!

Identify the root cause of negative feedback: \nStart by analyzing the negative feedback received and categorizing them based on the root cause of the issue. For example, if customers are complaining about delayed responses, analyze the reasons behind the delay, such as understaffing or inefficient processes. Once you identify the root cause, take corrective actions to resolve the issue. This will not only address the negative feedback but also prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, leading to overall customer satisfaction.\n2. Personalize customer experience: \nAnalyze the positive feedback received and identify common themes that customers appreciate. Use this information to personalize the customer experience by tailoring the service to individual customer needs. For example, if a customer has previously mentioned a particular product they like, recommend similar products or provide them with exclusive discounts. By personalizing the experience, customers are more likely to feel valued and satisfied.\n3. Empower employees to resolve issues: \nTrain your customer service team to handle complaints effectively and provide them with the authority to resolve issues on the spot. This will not only save time but also prevent the need for escalation, resulting in faster resolution and better customer satisfaction. Additionally, empowering employees to resolve issues will also make them feel valued and motivated, leading to better performance and overall customer service.",

This will give you a choice as to which style and layout you want the document to be created in.\n2. In the search bar, type the word “screenplay.”  Currently, Microsoft offers one premade screenplay template for MS Word 2013/2016.  Double click on it after the search is completed.  This will launch the screenplay-formatted document.\nIn MS Word 2010, the steps are essentially the same.  Open a new document, then select templates, and search Microsoft Office Online.  Choose one of the two available, then download it.\n3. There are no hard and fast rules governing the style in which screenplays are produced, though there are general guidelines, vocabulary, and common features.  Check with the specific studio you’re writing for to find out how to customize your specific document.  Think about how to adjust margins, font size, fonts, and line spacing.\n4. If you’ve already written or have a screenplay saved on your hard drive, open it in MS Word.  In Word 2013/2016, click File > Save As > Computer.  Type a name for your template in the file name box.  Then, in the drop-down “save as type” menu just below the file name box, select Word Template.  If the document contains macros, select Word Macro-Enable Template.  Click save.\nIf you want to change the location where your template will be saved, click File > Options > Save and type the folder path you want to use in the default personal templates location box.\n5. If you’re unhappy with the template layout provided by Word, you can modify the style and formatting of your document in order to create new formatting patterns.  These patterns could be used again if you save them, or you can create a new template based on a document which uses these style and formatting rules.  You could think of formatting as creating your own template.\n6. The text might be a character name, a piece of dialogue, or some stage directions.  Select the line of text by clicking the left button on your mouse with your cursor at the left edge of the line of text.\n\nAlternately, you could highlight the text by clicking the left button of your mouse to the right or left of the line of text you want to adjust.\nFinally, you could highlight text by bringing up a blinking cursor within the text you’ve written and holding down the shift key and an arrow key to highlight the text you want to format.  To highlight text to the left of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the left directional button.  To highlight text to the right of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the right directional arrow.\nIf you have multiple lines of text, you can select them at one time and apply the formatting changes you desire to all highlighted lines.\n7. With your text highlighted, click on the word “Format” on the menu bar.  The drop down menu will display several options.  Click on the words “Styles and Formatting.”  This will open the Styles and Formatting pane.\nAlternately, you can open the Styles and Formatting pane by clicking the Styles and Formatting button on the toolbar.  Just click the Styles and Formatting button located next to the script character drop-down menu to open the pane.  The button is found at the far left edge of the toolbar.  It contains two letter “A”s, each of a different color, with one positioned above and to the left of the other.\n8. Right click on the still-highlighted text you selected initially.  A drop-down menu will open with a number of options.  The bottom-most option reads “Select Text with Similar Formatting.”  Click on this option with the left button of your mouse.  All text with formatting similar to that which you highlighted originally will become highlighted.\nSo, for instance, if you have all character names in a certain font and size centered exactly above a line of text, you can highlight a single instance of any character’s name, then use the “Select text with similar formatting” option to adjust all character names in your screenplay at once.\n9. After you’ve highlighted all the text you want to assign a given style, choose a style from the pane on the right.  The Styles and Formatting pane should still be open on the right of the screen.  Choose the style format you want to change the highlighted text to by left-clicking on it.\n10. If your highlighted text does not conform to an extant style, you can assign the formatting and style within the highlighted text a name by clicking the button near the top of the pane which reads “New Style.”  You can then assign a name, align the text to left or right, choose your font, and make other adjustments as you see fit.\n11. Typically in a screenplay, the master scene heading (also known as a slug line) is the series of words which broadly identify the content which follows.  For instance, scene headings might read “INT. OFFICE - DAY” (interior office during the day).  This helps orient the screenplay’s reader to the scene.\nScene headings should, as in the aforementioned example, be in all caps, two lines down from the last line of dialogue or description in the previous scene.\n12. A macro is a sequence of saved commands which can be executed immediately by assigning them to a single keystroke.  To prepare your macro, set your margins.  Format page margins by clicking on the Layout tab, then Margins, then Custom Margins. The top, bottom and right margins should be set at 1\". The left margin should be set to 1.5\". Set font to Courier New, 12 point.  These choices are standard in screenplays.  If you’d like to work with a different layout, set your margins accordingly.\nIn Word 2007, prepare to record the macro by setting your margins.  Format page margins by clicking on the Page Layout tab, then set the margins and font to the designations listed above.  Then open the Developer tab. Display the Developer tab by opening the office button (the top left button), Word Options (at the bottom), under Popular check Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.\n13. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for setting up scenes, assigning the name “Scene heading” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro.  This button is located on the left side of the developer tab.  Store the macro in Document 1 (instead of Normal, so that you can save it as a distinct screenplay template). Name the macro 'Scene' or 'Heading'. Click the keyboard icon to assign the macro to a keyboard shortcut.  You can then press the keyboard button you wish to assign to the macro.  For example, perhaps you want to bind F2 to your macro.  In the “Press New Shortcut Key” box, press F2 to bind it.  Click Assign, then Close.\n14. Then assign the macro to F2 (or whatever button you want to assign it to) using the “Press New Shortcut Key” clickable box.  Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\n15. Press Enter on your keyboard twice to skip two lines.  Go back into Page Layout tab (Layout tab in Word 2007)and change both indentations back to 0.  Open the Home tab.  Click on the bottom right corner of the Font section to open the dialog box. Then in the Effects section, check All Caps and click OK.\n16. Click the View tab again.  Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F2 (your shortcut key) will now skip two lines down the page and capitalize text, preparing you to enter a scene heading.\nIn Word 2007, go back to the Developer tab.  Click Stop Recording. F2 (your shortcut key) will now skip two lines down and capitalize the text.\n17. Description in a screenplay offers more info than does the simple scene heading.  It might offer details about the type of lighting, weather conditions, or other descriptions of the physical location of the scene and its characters.  Description is located two lines below the scene heading in a standard sentence format, with the first letter capitalized and a period at the end.  For instance, below a scene heading  like “INT. OFFICE - DAY” we might read descriptive info such as “The window is open and the lights are flickering on and off.”\n18. In the bottom right corner of the Paragraph section, click the little icon that opens the dialog box.  Set 1’’ indents before text and 1.5’’ after text under the Indentation section.\nIn Word 2007, display the Developer tab.  Click the Office button at the top left, then go to Word Options (at the bottom), then under Popular, check “Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.”\n19. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for description, assigning the name “Description” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\n20. Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro on the left side of the ribbon.  Store the macro in the same place you stored the other macro you created, and name it “Description.” Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F3.\n21. Hit Enter twice on your keyboard to skip a couple lines, then go to the Layout tab (Page Layout tab in Word 2007) and move both indentations to 0.  Next, click on the Home tab.  In the bottom right corner of the Font section, select the little icon which opens the dialog box to open it.  Look under the Effects section, then deselect All Caps.  Click OK.\nIn word 2007, after deselecting All Caps, return to the Developer tab and press Stop Recording before continuing with the rest of the above directions.\n22. Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F3 will now skip two lines down the page and be lowercase.  If you do not bind the macro to the F3 key, F3 will not be useful as a hotkey to setup descriptive passages in your screenplay.\nIn Word 2007, return to the Developer tab and press Stop Recording instead of clicking Macros > Stop Recording.\n23. Characters and their dialogue or actions typically follow the introduction and descriptive info which sets a scene.  They should be centered in all caps on the page with dialogue following on the line below.\n\nTo create a macro which will prepare you to input character names after writing scene description, repeat the same steps used to create a macro for description in MS Word 2013/2016, but:\n\na) after changing the indentation back to 0 during recording, press the space bar 22 times, then select the All Caps and\nb) name the macro 'Character' and assign it to F4. Be sure that the first thing done during recording is to skip down two lines.\n\n\nAfter pressing Stop Recording, F4 will skip two lines down the page (thus bringing the cursor to the correct character name position) and capitalize.\nTo create a dialogue macro for Word 2007, follow the directions for the description macro in Word 2007 but input the parameters outlined in the sub-steps above.\n24. In the bottom right corner of the Paragraph section, there’s a little icon.  Click it and a dialog box will open.  Set 1’’ indents before text and 1.5’’ after text under the Indentation section.\nIn Word 2007, display the Developer tab.  At the top left of the Word window, there’s a multicolored button known as the Office button.  Click it and go to Word Options (at the bottom).  Under Popular, check “Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.”\n25. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for dialogue, assigning the name “Dialogue” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\n\nClick the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F5.  Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro.  The button to record the macro is on the left side of the ribbon.  Store the Macro in the same place you stored the other macro you created, and name it “Description.”  Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro a button of your choice.  For example, maybe you want to use F5.  Click within the “Press New Shortcut Key” and then press the F5 button to assign this macro to F5.\n26. Hit Enter once on your keyboard to skip a line, then go into the Page Layout tab and move both indentations to 0.  Next, click on the Home tab.  In the bottom right corner of the Font section, select the little icon which opens the dialog box to open it.  Look under the Effects section, then select All Caps.  Click OK.\n\nClick the View tab again.  Click Macros > Stop Recording.

        "output": "Organizational learning is the process of creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge within an organization. An organization improves over time as it gains experience. From this experience, it is able to create knowledge. This knowledge is broad, covering any topic that could better an organization. Examples may include ways to increase production efficiency or to develop beneficial investor relations. Knowledge is created at four different units: individual, group, organizational, and inter organizational.\nThe most common way to measure organizational learning is a learning curve. Learning curves are a relationship showing how as an organization produces more of a product or service, it increases its productivity, efficiency, reliability and/or quality of production with diminishing returns. Learning curves vary due to organizational learning rates. Organizational learning rates are affected by individual proficiency, improvements in an organization's technology, and improvements in the structures, routines and methods of coordination."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Q: What can I do in order to help continue the amazing unity among Am Yisrael that began during the time of the teens' kidnapping?\nA: Speak with others, telling them that what binds us together is greater than what seperates us. By the way, there is a place which has even greater unity: Tzahal!\nQ: Is Hamas an agent of Hashem, causing us to atone for our transgressions? And if not, why doesn't Hashem destroy them and make it easier for Am Yisrael?\nA: For the same reason that since the time of Kayin there are evil people and murderers in the world (see Ha-Rav's book \"Ve-Gavar Yisrael\" which discusses the problem of evil in the world and why bad things happen to good people).\nQ: What should a person do if he is in the middle of the Shemoneh Esrei and hears a warning siren for an incoming missile?\nA: He should run to the bomb shelter and continue to Daven the Shemoneh Esrei there. This is based on two factors: 1. It is a case of a life-threatening situation. 2. Walking in the middle of the Shemoneh Esrei without speaking is not considered an interruption. For example, if I am Davening the Shemoneh Esrei and a child is bothering me to the point that I cannot concentrate, I can move to another place. Or if I am Davening by heart and I cannot remember \"Ya'ale Ve-Yavo,\" I can go and get a Siddur. Speaking is forbidden, but there is no problem of moving if there is a need (Mishnah Berurah 104:2). Therefore, if I am in the middle of the Shemoneh Esrei and I hear a warning siren for an incoming missile, I should go to the bomb shelter without talking and continue to Daven where I left off (Piskei Teshuvot, Orach Chaim 104. Shut Be'er Moshe 3:13. Nes Lehitnoses by Ha-Rav Yoel Schwartz at the end, in the Q&A of Ha-Rav Yitzchak Zilberstein during the Gulf War #39).\nQ: A Rabbi said that missiles will not fall in a particular city. Is it permissible to rely on him and not enter the bomb shelter?\nA: In general, one should obey the directives of the Home Front Command. But you should ask the Rabbi directly (These were the words of Ha-Rav Chaim Kanievsky regarding Bnei Brak, based on the promise of the Chazon Ish. However, I heard that Rav Kanievsky said that one should go into the bomb shelter in order to feel distress with the rest of Am Yisrael. See Rashi on Shemot 17:12).\nQ: If I learn Torah in order to protect myself from the missiles, is it considered a violation of \"One who makes unworthy use of the crown [of Torah] shall pass away\" (Pirkei Avot 1:13)?\nA: No. It is considered learning Torah not for its own sake (see Nefesh Ha-Chaim, Sha'ar #4. Shut Yechaveh Daat 3:73).\nQ: Does one who goes out of his house during missile fire, violate \"Guard your soul very carefully\" (Devarim 4:10).\nA: One is always obligated to follow directives of the Home Front Command and not try to outsmart them.\nQ: During this time, should we be frightened, recite Tehillim and Daven, based on the idea that we should cry out to Hashem during a time of distress, or should we not get excited and continue in our routine in order to show that we will not bow to terror and will not be scare us?\nA: Continue on with strength and courage during our state of war, which began with the establishment of the State of Israel. But a courageous person also Davens to Hashem, as we see with Yaakov Avinu before his meeting with Esav: He sent gifts, Davened and prepared for war (Rashi on Bereshit 32:9).\nQ: What can I do in order to help Tzahal be victorious?\nA: Repent, Daven and give Tzedakah. It is already certain, however, that Tzahal will be victorious, but you can help make the process faster and less costly.\nQ: It is permissible for me to sleep in a bomb shelter with my husband if other men are also there?\nA: Yes, in a corner.\nQ: In light of the situation, should we add prayers to the Davening?\nA: There is no need. This is the normal state of war with our enemies, which has been going on since the establishment of the State of Israel.\nQ: I live in Northern Israel. Is it permissible to travel to the Kotel for a Bar Mitzvah when missiles are currently falling in Yerushalayim and the south?\nA: It is a negligible risk. You may travel unless the Home Front Command says otherwise (see Piskei Teshuvah, Yoreh Deah 157)."

The scenario can involve setting project goals, assigning tasks to team members, and monitoring progress towards the deadline. The interviewee can also be evaluated on their ability to communicate with team members, resolve conflicts, and make decisions under pressure.\nTo incorporate a surprise twist where one team member unexpectedly quits mid-project, we can add a random event that triggers the resignation. The interviewee will then need to handle the situation by reassigning tasks, communicating with the team, and ensuring that the project goals are still met despite the setback.\nHere's a Ruby code snippet that demonstrates how we can simulate this scenario:\n```\nclass ProjectManager\n  attr_accessor :team, :deadline\n  def initialize(team, deadline)\n    @team = team\n    @deadline = deadline\n  end\n  def assign_tasks\n    # Assign tasks to team members based on their skills and availability\n  end\n  def monitor_progress\n    # Monitor progress towards the deadline and ensure that project goals are met\n  end\n  def handle_resignation\n    # If a team member resigns, reassign their tasks and communicate with the team to ensure project goals are still met\n  end\nend\n# Create a team of developers, designers, and marketers\nteam = [\"developer1\", \"developer2\", \"designer1\", \"designer2\", \"marketer1\", \"marketer2\"]\n# Set a deadline for the project\ndeadline = Time.new(2022, 12, 31)\n# Create a project manager\npm = ProjectManager.new(team, deadline)\n# Assign tasks to team members\npm.assign_tasks\n# Monitor progress towards the deadline\npm.monitor_progress\n# Simulate a resignation\nteam.delete_at(rand(team.length))\npm.handle_resignation\n```\nIn this code snippet, we create a `ProjectManager` class that takes a team and deadline as input. We then define methods to assign tasks to team members, monitor progress towards the deadline, and handle a resignation if it occurs. Finally, we create an instance of the `ProjectManager` class, assign tasks to team members, monitor progress, and simulate a resignation by randomly removing a team member from the list."

        "input": "Operation Aurora was a series of cyber attacks conducted by advanced persistent threats such as the Elderwood Group based in Beijing, China, with ties to the People's Liberation Army. First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.\n\nThe attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.\n\nThe attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways—much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\nHistory\n\nFlowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted. As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China. On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.\n\nIn Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\". The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.\n\nAttackers involved\nFurther information: Cyberwarfare by China\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company – a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\nAttack analysis\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.\n\nVeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\nResponse and aftermath\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"\n\nSecurity company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week.[clarification needed] \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.\n\nResearchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8—even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.[dubious – discuss] According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"\n\nMicrosoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\n\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.\n\nIn March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\nGoogle retrospective\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "As John falls off the cliff, he experiences a range of physical sensations, including a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and intense fear. He may also feel a sense of weightlessness as he falls, followed by a sudden jolt as he hits the ground. The impact of the fall could cause severe injuries, including fractures, internal bleeding, and head trauma.\nEmotionally, John may experience a range of intense feelings, including panic, terror, and a sense of helplessness. He may feel like he is in a dream-like state or dissociated from his surroundings. These emotional responses are common in traumatic events like falling from a great height.\nThe long-term psychological effects of this traumatic experience could be significant. According to research, traumatic events like falling from a height can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders. In a study conducted by Breslau et al. (1999), individuals who experienced a traumatic event like a fall were more likely to develop PTSD and other anxiety disorders than those who did not experience such an event.\nIn addition to PTSD and anxiety disorders, John may experience other psychological effects, such as depression, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts. These effects can be long-lasting and may require professional help to manage.\nTo help John cope with the aftermath of this traumatic event, a treatment plan that includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is recommended. Pharmacological interventions may include the use of antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and sleep aids. These medications can help to alleviate symptoms of PTSD and anxiety disorders.\nNon-pharmacological interventions may include psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and exposure therapy. These therapies can help John process his traumatic experience, develop coping skills, and reduce anxiety and other symptoms. Exposure therapy, in particular, can help John overcome his fear of heights and prevent future incidents.\nIn conclusion, falling from a great height can be a traumatic experience that can have long-lasting psychological effects. John may develop PTSD and anxiety disorders, among other psychological effects. A treatment plan that includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is recommended to help him cope with the aftermath of this traumatic event."

        "instruction": "For someone who is new to play video games, what would be 22 key steps to get started?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Choosing a video game or learning to play it can overwhelm someone unfamiliar with them. Fortunately, the vast number of options also means that  there is almost certainly a game you love. With a little direction and advice, you can start exploring a virtual world in no time.\n1. Choose a platform.: Playing video games no longer requires a dedicated console or a souped-up gaming computer. There are an increasing number of quality games available for your laptop, old computer, smartphone, or tablet. Get a taste for these first before you shell out hundreds of dollars for a console or computer upgrades. Once you've decided to explore new territory, keep the following in mind:\n\nFor the largest number of available games, get a desktop computer running the latest operating system, and install a good video card.\nFor a cheap, easy to set up option, purchase a console. Choose a latest-generation console (PS4, Switch, or Xbox One) to play new games, or an old one (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 or even earlier) for a large selection of cheap, used classics.\nChoose a handheld gaming system for a specific game you can't get on your phone.\n2. Check the game rating.: Game rating systems vary between each country, but an explanation should be available on the packaging or online description. Games rated M for mature or for an age range 17 or higher typically contain extreme violence or disturbing scenes.\n3. Read the system requirements.: If you are using a console, you should be able to play any game for that console. Computer gamers need to find out their computer specifications and check them against the requirements on the game packaging or website. There are typically two sets of requirements listed:\n\n\"Required\" lists the bare minimum. If you fall short of any of these requirements, don't purchase the game. If you barely meet these requirements, the game will probably be slow and/or look much worse than trailers and screenshots show.\n\"Recommended\" requirements should let you play the game with shorter loading times, no lag or visual glitches, and better graphics settings.\n4. Watch video reviews.: Games are a huge business, and the actual gameplay sometimes fails to live up to marketing hype. Find at least one review before you purchase an expensive game, preferably a video one so you can watch the gameplay first hand.\n5. Hear about new games and old classics.: If you have gamer friends, you'll probably hear about new games whether you like it or not. Other sources of information include gaming blogs and magazines, which you can find with a quick online search, or browsing the vast collection of computer games on Steam, the free game store.\n6. Feel free to jump into sequels.: Don't feel obligated to play the first game in a series. The sequels often have improved gameplay and graphics, and often don't even follow the previous story directly.\n7. Be cautious with competitive games.: If you don't consider yourself a gamer, there are certain genres that you may not enjoy. First-person shooters, fighting games, \"battle arenas\" like League of Legends, and to a lesser extent sports games tend to be fiercely competitive. These are often extremely difficult for a new player to learn.\n\nIf you have your heart set on learning one of these genres, pick one with a single-player mode that lets you learn on your own, such as Halo.\nSome specific games in different genres fall into this category as well. The Starcraft and Dark Souls series are not recommended for inexperienced gamers.\n8. Try before you buy.: If you're uncertain about a game, look for a free demo version. If this isn't available, consider renting the game from the Gamefly website, or from a brick-and-mortar store.\n9. Play free introductory games.: If you've never got into a video game before, you might want to try a few free ones first to see what you enjoy. A quick search online or in an app store for \"free games\" will give you thousands of results, but here are a few suggestions you should be able to find in an online search:\n\nPuzzle games are easy to find in mobile app stores or online flash game sites. If you've had your fill of classics like Tetris and Minesweeper, try Loops of Zen, 3D Logic, Lightbot, and many more.\n\nMost free action games on mobile or online aren't great introductions to their more \"gamer\"-oriented counterparts. If you have a decent computer, Path of Exile is a more expansive introduction.\n\nIf you like strategy, try Hearthstone (collectible card game), Plants vs Zombies (tower defense), or Battle for Wesnoth (turn-based strategy). All three are available for both computer and mobile platforms, and most versions are free.\n10. Find more puzzle games.: Some of the biggest casual \"coffee break\" puzzle games include Candy Crush and 2048. Take it to three dimensions and add a quirky story to discover the acclaimed Portal and Portal 2. If nothing but the most cerebral and fiendishly difficult will do, play Braid.\n11. Search for action games.: This is a broad and popular genre. If you like fighting and platforming (leaping and climbing around), look no further. The atmosphere and setting of these games ranges from horror (The Last of Us) to family-friendly (Legend of Zelda) to historical (Assassin's Creed). If you like testing your reflexes but don't really care about story or immersive experiences, try a competitive first-person shooter (such as Call of Duty) or a family-friendly platformer (such as Super Mario Galaxy).\nIf you'd rather mess around or have fun with friends than explore and follow a story, try Super Smash Brothers (family friendly) or Grand Theft Auto (the opposite of family friendly).\n12. Play story-based games.: Enjoy sprawling fantasy settings? Play Dragon Age or Skyrim for a pseudo-medieval experience, or one of the more recent Final Fantasy games for the Japanese take. Bioshock 2 or Bioshock: Infinite are more unsettling examples set in utopias gone wrong.\n13. Pick up a few strategy games.: Build an empire with turn-based strategy in Civilization V or Civilization: Beyond Earth. Test your reflexes with fast-paced \"real-time strategy\" games such as the challenging multi-player game Starcraft II. Try any Total War game to test your single-player tactical skills or play the role of famous historical figures.\n14. Try games of exploration and creativity.: If you don't care about graphics, there are few games more appealing than Minecraft when it comes to building a world. Maybe controlling a house and family in The Sims 2 is more up your alley, or perhaps you'd prefer a more detailed world and atmosphere in Sunless Sea.\n15. Play a multiplayer online role-playing game.: World of Warcraft popularized this genre, in which you play online with thousands of other players. WoW is still around alongside Star Wars: The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, and many, many others. Most of these are partially free to play, but find out what the full version's payment system is like before you get involved. These games are infamously addictive, and once you're hooked you might find yourself spending a great deal of money on monthly subscription payments or in-game purchases.\n16. Learn to play.: Most games have tutorials that will walk you through the game play. If you prefer to learn on your own, read the instruction manual, or look for the \"documentation\" section on the main menu or website.\n17. Dim the lights (optional).: This is recommended for adventure and horror games especially. Besides a greater feeling of immersion, this will cut down on glare interfering with your ability to see the screen.\n18. Turn down the difficulty if you like.: Games don't have to be about suffering or pushing yourself to the limit. If you're playing a video game to unwind, set it to Easy difficulty. The harder difficulty levels are often intended to be difficult challenges for people who have played similar games for years.\nIf the game has both single-player and multi-player options, the single-player portion is almost always easier.\n19. Change the controls if necessary.: You can ignore this step until it's an issue, but if you find yourself hitting the wrong button or straining your fingers, visit the menu options. There's almost always an option to change the controls to whichever key you find easiest.\n\nA laptop trackpad makes it extremely difficult to play some games. An actual mouse is a big improvement.\nIf you like the feel of a console controller, these are available to plug in to your computer as well, if you have the right adapter. Not all games support this, however.\n20. Save often.: Most games have an auto-save feature that will save your progress regularly. If it also has the option to save manually, do so often. There's nothing worse than losing hours of progress because your system crashes or the power goes out.\nIf you have the option to use multiple save slots, create three or four and rotate between them. This lets you load an old save to explore a different story branch, or recover your game even if a bug screws up your most recent save.\n21. Explore and experiment.: One of the most appealing features of video games compared to other art forms is the ability to insert hidden content that you have to actively search for and discover. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of your games:\n\nIn platformers, role-playing games, or even racing games, try to move through or attack walls that look out of place with their surroundings.\nIn strategy games and action/adventure games, try new tactics even if they don't seem great. The later parts of the game (or harder competition) often require the ability to recognize when an unusual weapon or strategy has a chance to shine.\nIn games where you can talk to \"NPCs\" (non-player characters), use every dialogue option and read closely for hints.\n22. Get help when you're stuck.: Unless your only goal is bragging rights, why spend hours losing to the same fight or stuck on the same puzzle? Search for the game name and the word \"walkthrough\" online, and you'll find strategy advice or answers for every part of the game. If you prefer to solve it mostly on your own, ask friends or gaming forums for hints and advice. Hints and advice can make the game easier!\nIf it's not possible to follow the walkthrough advice (such as talking to a dead character), or if you are following the instructions but nothing is happening, it could be a bug. Search online for a description of your situation and you might find other players who can help you fix it.\n"

If I implement same task using MySQL-fulltext indexes (it allows to search for strings which contain all given words) then 1 search takes about 0.4s.

        "output": "I'll list two possible approaches that might be reasonably effective in practice, though their worst-case running time is no better than what you listed.\n\nIndices\n\nYou can build up an index for each word.  Build a hash table.  For each word that appears in any clean name, the hashtable maps that word to a list of all dirty names that contain that word.  This hashtable can be built up once in a linear scan of the set of dirty names (Set2).\n\nThen, given a clean name, iterate over the words in the clean name.  For each word, look it up in the hash table, and iterate over all the dirty names that contain that word, and check how many words it has in common with the clean name.  Keep the best match.\n\nThis can be optimized a bit.  If the clean name contains a word that occurs in many dirty names, handling that word will be slow.  So, you could find the number of times each word occurs in some dirty name (its frequency) and store this in a hash table.  Then, given a clean name, you could iterate over the words in the clean name in order of increasing frequency, keeping track of the best match you've found so far.  If you've found a match of length $\\ell$, then you can stop the iteration early without iterating over $\\ell-1$ highest-frequency words in the clean name without missing any valid matches.\n\nTries\n\nThe order of words in a name is irrelevant, so sort the words in each phrase.  For instance, 'some good product' becomes 'good product some'.  Do this to each name in each set.\n\nNext, build a trie to represent the set of good names (Set1).  For instance, in your example the trie will be\n\n+-- another --+-- product --+\n|`-- blah --+\n|`-- good --+-- product --+-- some --+\n `-- name --+-- some --+\n\n\nNow, pick a dirty name.  We want to find a match for it from the trie.  I suggest you use a recursive algorithm to find all matches: to find a match for the name $w_1 \\cdots w_n$ in the trie $T$, check whether there is an edge out of the root of $T$ labelled $w_1$, and if so, re"

The name white hydrogen distinguishes it from green hydrogen, which is produced from renewable energy sources, and from grey, brown or black hydrogen, which is obtained from fossil sources or from the electrolysis of water. Natural hydrogen may be renewable, non-polluting and allows for lower cost operation compared to industrial hydrogen. Natural hydrogen has been identified in many source rocks in areas beyond the sedimentary basins where oil companies typically operate.\n\nOrigin of natural hydrogen\nThere are several sources of natural hydrogen:\n\n- degassing of deep hydrogen from the Earth's crust and mantle;\n- reaction of water with ultrabasic rocks (serpentinisation);\n- contact of water with reducing agents in the Earth's mantle;\n- interaction of water with freshly exposed rock surfaces (weathering);\n- decomposition of hydroxyl ions in the structure of minerals;\n- Natural radiolysis of water;\n- decomposition of organic matter;\n- biological activity\n- Extraction\n- Natural hydrogen is extracted from wells, mixed with other gases such as nitrogen or helium.\n\nSeveral sources have been identified in France. Geologists Alain Prinzhofer and Eric Derville have demonstrated the existence of large reservoirs in a dozen countries, including Mali and the United States. However, their potential remains difficult to assess.\n\nNumerous emanations on the ocean floor have been identified but are difficult to exploit. The discovery of a significant emergence in Russia in 2008 suggests the possibility of extracting native hydrogen in geological environments.\n\nGeology\nNatural hydrogen is generated continuously from a variety of natural sources. There are many known hydrogen emergences on mid-ocean ridges. Another of the known reactions, serpentinisation, occurs under the sea floor (in the oceanic crust).\n\nDiagenetic origin (iron oxidation) in the sedimentary basins of cratons, notably in Russia. Other sources are being explored, such as mantle hydrogen, or hydrogen from radiolysis (natural electrolysis) or from bacterial activity. In France, the Alps and Pyrenees are suitable for exploitation. New Caledonia has hyperalkaline sources that show dihydrogen emissions. A large accumulation of natural hydrogen was discovered in Bourakebougou (Mali).\n\nCharacteristics\nDihydrogen is very soluble in fresh water, especially at depth (solubility increases with pressure).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hydrogen",
