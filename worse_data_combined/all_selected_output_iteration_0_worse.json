In countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, the service can be accessed without a full Prime subscription, whereas in Australia, Canada, France, India, Turkey, and Italy, it can only be accessed through a dedicated website. Prime Video additionally offers a content add-on service in the form of channels, called Amazon Channels, or Prime Video Channels, which allow users to subscribe to additional video subscription services from other content providers within Prime Video.\n\nLaunched on September 7, 2006, as Amazon Unbox in the United States, the service grew with an expanding library, and added the Prime Video membership upon the development of the Prime subscription. It was then renamed as Amazon Instant Video on Demand. After acquiring the UK-based streaming and DVD-by-mail service LoveFilm in 2011, Prime Video was added to the Prime subscription in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria in 2014, available on a monthly subscription of £/€8.99 per month, continuing the plan of LoveFilm Instant.

However, you cannot use loops or recursion. Instead, you must use a single line of code that involves only basic arithmetic operations and the input parameter. The function should return the factorial as an integer.\nHere is an example of what the code should look like:\npublic static int Factorial(int n)\n{\n    return Enumerable.Range(1, n).Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);\n}\nCan you explain how this code works, and suggest any further optimizations or alternative solutions?",

The Enumerable.Range method generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to n.\n2. The Aggregate method applies a function to each pair of numbers in the sequence, multiplying them together.\n3. The result of each multiplication is used as the first parameter (a) in the next multiplication, until all the numbers in the sequence have been multiplied together.\n4. The final result is returned as the factorial of the input parameter.\nThis code is already quite efficient and concise, but one possible optimization would be to use a tail-recursive function to calculate the factorial. This would avoid the overhead of creating a sequence of numbers and applying a function to each pair, and would instead use a series of nested function calls to calculate the factorial.\nHere's an example of what a tail-recursive factorial function in C# might look like:\npublic static int Factorial(int n, int acc = 1)\n{\n    if (n == 0)\n    {\n        return acc;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return Factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n    }\n}\nThis function takes two parameters: n, which is the input integer, and acc, which is an accumulator that keeps track of the factorial as it is calculated. The function checks if n is equal to 0, and if so, returns the accumulator as the factorial. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with n-1 and n*acc as the new parameters.\nThis tail-recursive function should be more efficient than the original code, since it avoids the overhead of creating a sequence of numbers and applying a function to each pair. However, it may be slightly less readable and harder to understand for someone who is not familiar with tail recursion."

Additionally, provide a comparison of the consequences of global warming on a regional level, specifically comparing the effects on developed versus developing nations. Finally, propose and justify at least three potential solutions to mitigate the effects of global warming and prevent further damage to the environment and society.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Global warming, also known as climate change, is the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The direct consequences of global warming are widespread and can be devastating for both the environment and society.\nChanges in sea levels are one of the most visible consequences of global warming. As the planet warms, glaciers and ice sheets melt, causing sea levels to rise. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global sea levels have risen by about 15 cm (6 inches) over the past century, and they are projected to rise by another 30-110 cm (1-3.6 feet) by the end of this century. This rise in sea levels can cause flooding, erosion of coastlines, and the displacement of coastal communities.\nExtreme weather events are another consequence of global warming. As the planet warms, it creates more energy in the atmosphere, leading to more frequent and intense heat waves, droughts, and wildfires. Additionally, warmer oceans can lead to more powerful hurricanes and typhoons. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the number of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the United States has increased from an average of 6.2 events per year in the 1980s to 16.3 events per year in the 2010s.\nBiodiversity loss is another consequence of global warming. As temperatures rise, many species are forced to migrate to cooler areas or face extinction. According to a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), global populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have declined by an average of 68% since 1970.\nGlobal warming also has a significant impact on human health. Heat waves and air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can lead to respiratory problems, heart attacks, and strokes. Additionally, the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever is linked to warmer temperatures.\nThe consequences of global warming are not evenly distributed around the world. Developing nations, which often have fewer resources to adapt to the effects of climate change, are likely to be hit the hardest. For example, according to the IPCC, many small island nations are at risk of being completely submerged by rising sea levels. Additionally, many developing countries rely heavily on agriculture, which is vulnerable to droughts and other extreme weather events.\nTo mitigate the effects of global warming, several solutions have been proposed. One potential solution is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Another solution is to increase energy efficiency by improving building insulation and using more efficient appliances. Additionally, reforestation and afforestation can help to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, global warming has a wide range of direct consequences, including changes in sea levels, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and impacts on human health. These consequences are not evenly distributed around the world, with developing nations likely to be hit the hardest. To mitigate the effects of global warming, several solutions have been proposed, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and reforestation."

For example, swapping out old incandescent light bulbs for LED bulbs can significantly reduce energy usage.\n2. Implement energy-saving practices: Encourage employees to turn off lights and equipment when they are not in use, and adjust the thermostat to reduce heating and cooling costs. Consider implementing a company-wide policy on energy conservation to encourage everyone to do their part.\nThe benefits of implementing these strategies can be significant. By reducing energy consumption, businesses can save money on their utility bills and reduce their carbon footprint.

The first team to score 25 points and have a two-point lead wins the set. A match is typically played in a best-of-five sets format.\nRegulations related to rotations or positions:\nPlayers must rotate clockwise after each serve, meaning that each player must take a turn serving and playing in each of the six positions on the court. Additionally, players must adhere to specific rules regarding where they can stand on the court during certain situations, such as serving or blocking.\nPopular tactics or strategies:\nSome common tactics used in volleyball include serving aggressively to force the opponent out of system, using quick sets to exploit holes in the opponent's defense, and running a variety of offensive plays to keep the opponent guessing.\nRole and responsibilities of the referee:\nThe referee is responsible for ensuring that the game is played according to the rules and regulations of the sport. They make calls on violations such as double hits, net touches, and foot faults. They also signal when a ball is in or out of bounds, and can overrule line judges if necessary.\nOverall, volleyball is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires a combination of skill, strategy, and teamwork.

We can then use machine learning algorithms to classify the complaints based on the most significant factor contributing to the issue.\nFor example, if a customer complaint mentions issues with the product quality, we can classify it as a product quality issue. Similarly, if a complaint mentions long shipping times, we can classify it as a shipping issue.\nOnce we have classified the complaints, we can analyze them to identify the most significant areas of improvement needed to address the issue. For example, if we find that a large number of complaints are related to product quality, we may need to improve our quality control processes or work with our suppliers to ensure that they are providing high-quality materials.\nSimilarly, if we find that customer service is a significant issue, we may need to provide additional training to our customer service representatives to ensure that they are knowledgeable and helpful. We may also need to improve our processes for handling customer complaints and ensure that we are providing timely and effective solutions.\nFinally, we can evaluate our pricing to ensure that it is reasonable for the quality of the product and service we are providing. If we find that our pricing is too high, we may need to adjust our prices or offer discounts to customers who have experienced issues.\nOverall, by analyzing and classifying customer complaints based on different factors, we can identify the root cause of the issue and develop a comprehensive plan to address it.

Once we have the data, we can use various statistical methods to analyze the churn rate by demographic groups. For example, we can calculate the churn rate for each age group, gender, and location and compare them to identify any significant differences.\nTo predict potential churn based on user behavior and engagement metrics, we can use machine learning algorithms that analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that indicate a high likelihood of churn. These algorithms can take into account factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the types of interactions, and the time spent on the platform. By analyzing these metrics, we can identify customers who are at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.\nTo address identified churn reasons and improve customer retention, we can implement various strategies such as:\n1. Improving the customer experience: By making the platform more user-friendly and addressing pain points, we can improve the overall customer experience and reduce churn.\n2. Offering incentives: Offering discounts, loyalty programs, or other incentives can encourage customers to stay with the platform.\n3. Providing better customer support: By providing responsive and helpful customer support, we can address customer issues and prevent churn.\n4. Personalizing the customer experience: By tailoring the platform to individual customer preferences, we can increase engagement and reduce churn.\n5.

Shape small portions of the dough into long \"snakes\". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.\n\n\nPotato Latkes\n\nIngredients\n2 1/2 pounds baking potatoes, coarsely shredded \n1 medium onion, coarsely shredded \n2 large eggs, beaten\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\nVegetable oil, for frying\nApplesauce, sour cream, smoked salmon and salmon roe, for serving\n\nInstructions\nIn a colander set over a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the onion and squeeze dry. Let the potatoes and onion drain for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour off the liquid in the bowl, leaving the starchy paste at the bottom. Add the potatoes and onion, along with the eggs, salt, pepper and mix well.\n\nIn a large skillet, heat an 1/8-inch layer of oil until shimmering. Spoon 1/4-cup mounds of the latke batter into the skillet about 2 inches apart and flatten slightly with a spatula. Fry the latkes over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the latkes to paper towels to drain, then transfer to a platter. Repeat to make the remaining latkes, adding more oil to the skillet as needed. \nServe with applesauce, sour cream, smoked salmon and salmon roe.\n\n\nPoutine\n\nIngredients\n3 or 4 large russet potatoes ( 3 to 4 pounds total), peeled and cut into 1/3-inch-wide sticks\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme\nFreshly cracked black pepper\n4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n½ teaspoon onion powder\n1 cup chicken broth\n1 cup beef broth\n1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n1 teaspoon Better Than Bouillon beef base or 1 beef bouillon cube\n1 teaspoon unfiltered apple cider vinegar\n10 ounces white cheddar cheese curds, at room temperature\nMinced fresh parsley\n\nInstructions\nMake the fries. Place the batons in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Let soak for at least 30 minutes up to 24 hours for crispier fries.\nPreheat the oven to 425°F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.\nSpread the potatoes out onto large, clean kitchen towels. Dry them off as best as possible. Place the potatoes on the prepared baking sheets, drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with the thyme and salt and add black pepper to taste. Toss to coat evenly, then spread out the potatoes into a single layer.\nBake for 10 minutes, then toss the fries and rotate the pans, swapping the one on the top for the one on the bottom. Increase the oven to 450°F and bake the fries for 10 minutes more.Toss the fries and swap the pans from top to bottom again. Turn on the broiler and cook the fries until they are beginning to brown and crisp, about 5 more minutes. Continue to toss and broil until the fries reach your desired doneness. Season with salt and pepper.\nMeanwhile, make the gravy. In a large saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle the flour over the butter and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic powder and onion powder. Slowly add the chicken and beef broth. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened. Stir in the Worcestershire, beef bouillon, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.\nTo assemble the poutine, divide the fries among 4 plates. Sprinkle it with the cheese curds, drizzle on the gravy, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately."

        "output": "To create a program that predicts the future market share of a business, we need to consider several factors such as past performance, industry trends, economic conditions, and consumer behavior. Here is a possible approach to build such a program:\n1. Collect and analyze historical data: The first step is to gather data on the business's past performance and market share over a certain period, say five years. We can also collect data on industry trends, economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and consumer behavior such as spending patterns, preferences, and demographics.\n2. Identify key variables: Based on the analysis of historical data, we need to identify the variables that have the most impact on the business's market share. For example, we may find that the business's pricing strategy, product quality, marketing efforts, and customer service have a significant influence on its market share.\n3. Develop a predictive model: Once we have identified the key variables, we can develop a predictive model that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast the business's market share in the future. The model should take into account the historical data and external factors such as changes in the economy and consumer behavior.\n4. Validate the model: We need to validate the predictive model by testing it on a subset of the historical data and comparing its predictions to the actual market share. If the model performs well, we can use it to make predictions for future periods.\n5. Monitor and update the model: Finally, we need to monitor the business's performance and update the predictive model periodically to incorporate new data and changes in the external environment. This will ensure that the model remains accurate and relevant over time.\nOverall, building a program that predicts the future market share of a business is a complex task that requires expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. However, with the right approach and tools, we can develop a reliable and actionable forecast that can help businesses make informed decisions about their future growth strategies."

The model can use its vast knowledge base to generate relevant and coherent language, drawing on existing research, technical terminology, and other sources.\n\n4. Review and refinement: Once GPT-3 has generated the abstract, the user can review the text and make any necessary changes or additions. They may also fine-tune the model by providing feedback on its language choices or adjusting the parameters of the input prompt.\n\nOverall, the ability of GPT-3 to analyze large amounts of text data and generate coherent, relevant language makes it a powerful tool for generating paper abstracts, saving researchers time and effort in the writing process."

GNP, on the other hand, measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country's citizens, regardless of where they are located.\nNNP subtracts depreciation from GNP to account for the wear and tear on capital goods, while NDP subtracts depreciation from GDP to account for the wear and tear on a country's infrastructure.\nIn terms of accuracy, reliability, and relevance, GDP is generally considered the most accurate and reliable measure of economic growth, as it provides a comprehensive snapshot of a country's economic activity. However, it does not account for factors such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and the distribution of wealth.\nGNP is less commonly used than GDP, but it can be more relevant for countries with large diaspora populations or significant foreign investment. NNP and NDP are less commonly used than GDP and GNP, but they can provide a more accurate picture of a country's economic growth by accounting for the depreciation of capital goods and infrastructure.\nIn certain situations, certain methods may be more suitable than others. For example, if a country has a large diaspora population that contributes significantly to its economy, GNP may be a more relevant measure of economic growth than GDP. Alternatively, if a country has significant infrastructure investments, NDP may be a more accurate measure of economic growth than GDP. Ultimately, the choice of methodology will depend on the specific circumstances and goals of the analysis."

As of June 2022, Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (known for Google), Amazon, Meta (known for Facebook), and Microsoft.\n\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020, and $3 trillion in January 2022. As of January 2023, it was valued at around $2.2 trillion. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.",

Bush’s administration suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nIn recent years, Azar has defended pricing practices, and argued against the approaches to reduce costs to consumer s as Trump endorsed during his campaign, such as allowing the government to negotiate drug prices and importing medicines from oversees.\nInstead, Azar has followed the pharma messaging playbook on drug pricing — deflecting attention to other parts of the health system, and even other countries, blaming them for the high drug costs paid by U.S. patients. He’s also justified drug prices as the cost of innovation.\nTrump’s focus on drug pricing in announcing Azar’s nomination didn’t win over doubters, who no longer believe he is serious about going after the industry he once slammed as “getting away with murder.” But it will make it easier for critics to pounce on what will likely be the toughest barrier for Azar to overcome during his confirmation process in the Senate.\nSen. Bernie Sanders said Monday he will “vigorously oppose” the nomination of Azar.\n“During Mr. Azar’s tenure at Eli Lilly, this multi billion-dollar corporation dodged taxes while charging Americans outrageously high prices for life saving prescription drugs,” Sanders said.\nSanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings commenced an investigation into Eli Lilly’s rising prices for insulin last year, spurring attorneys generals in Washington and New Mexico to look into the matter. The lawmakers questioned why the prices of the diabetes medicine whose main patent expired 75 years ago have seen huge jumps in recent years, with competitors often raising prices in tandem. One of Eli Lilly’s insulins, Humulin R U-500, rose 325 percent in price from 2010 to 2015.\nCummings tweeted that picking Azar is “like a fox guarding the hen house,” and a “slap in the face,” to Americans waiting for action on lower drug prices.\nAzar contends the outrage over drug pricing “erupted because we have seen a complete fundamental restructuring of health insurance,” with a shift to high-deductible plans that puts the burden of drug costs on employees and individuals, he said at a conference in May.\nWhile Azar makes a valid point, changing insurance policies without addressing drugmakers’ markups of existing drug prices, or high launch prices for new medicines, “is avoiding the elephant in the room.” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies drug prices at Harvard Medical School.\nEven Azar acknowledged in his speech that if insurance companies reduced consumers’ out of pocket charges for medicines, those costs would show up elsewhere, likely in premium increases.\nAzar has also attacked government regulators and payers for devaluing pharmaceutical innovation, suggesting that if the U.S. cuts pharma profits, it will see decreased investment in new drugs and fewer new cures.\n“The narrow focus of costs of medicine to the exclusion of innovation would be self-defeating in the long run,” Azar said in a 2014 speech.\nSarpatwari worries such views will lead Azar to promote the idea that making it quicker and easier for drug makers to introduce new medicines will reduce pharmaceutical costs. Researchers have found that drug companies don’t price their products any cheaper when FDA lets them use the accelerated approval process or other tactics to speed drugs to market. Former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf recently said that despite claims by the Trump administration that faster drug approvals lead to lower cost drugs, there is no direction relationship between the cost of development and price of drugs.\nNonetheless, in June, Azar told Fox Business that getting more new drugs to market to increase competition among brands would help bring U.S. prices down. Yet there’s only one example the drug industry can point to in the U.S. where brand competition has led to lower prices — and many where competitors simply raise prices in tandem. For example, Democrats recently launched a probe into the rising price of multiple sclerosis drugs where drugs introduced decades ago have raised prices to match their newer competitors.\nAnd while Azar expresses support for competition, one of the major factors keeping generic versions of insulin off the market have been drug company tactics known as evergreening — making incremental tweaks to their insulin versions or the devices that deliver it, to extend their monopolies for decades.\nAn article published in The Lancet in late 2015 found that most of the recent innovation in the insulin market has centered on improvements in delivery devices, blocking generics by agents that are indirectly related to the drug.\nAzar has also opposed other ideas to encourage competitive drug pricing. He’s spoken out against studies known as comparative effectiveness research, used to determine which drugs are most cost-effective for treating patients with a disease. He argues that all options should be available since different patients may need different medicines. The problem however, is that if payers must make all drugs available, they have little leverage to negotiate lower drug prices with industry.\nThe result is that despite Trump’s tweets praising Azar as a champion for lower costs , few fighting for lower drug prices are pinning their hopes on action by Azar.\n“This nominee has impeccable big pharma credentials but non-existent credentials when it comes to concerns on drug prices,” said Peter Welch, co-chair of the House Democrats Drug Pricing Task Force."

        "output": "LOS ANGELES -- A 30-year-old woman was charged with attempted murder Thursday for allegedly beating a 92-year-old man with a brick last week, CBS Los Angeles reports. The L.A. County District Attorney's Office says Laquisha Jones, of Los Angeles, has also been charged with elder abuse, infliction of injury.\nJones entered a not guilty plea at her arraignment Thursday. Prosecutors asked that bail be set at $1.125 million.\nThe felony complaint includes special allegations that the defendant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, the brick, during the beating and that she badly injured the victim, identified as Rodolfo Rodriguez. He was visiting the U.S. from his native Mexico.\nThe charging document alleges that Jones was previously convicted of making criminal threats, in 2017. Jones was on probation from that case, CBS L.A. says.\nProsecutors said Jones attacked the elderly man with a brick on the evening of July 4.\nAfterward, Rodriguez was taken to the hospital for medical treatment and Jones fled the scene, according to authorities.\nInvestigators identified Jones as the alleged assailant, and arrested her July 10.\nIf convicted as charged, she faces a maximum of 29 years in state prison.\nHe told his family he was walking down the street when he bumped into a little girl as he tried to walk around her.\nThe suspect, believed to be the girl's mother, allegedly threw Rodriguez to the ground and starting hitting him with her fists, then the brick.\nA witness said she heard the suspect tell the victim to \"Go back to your country.\"\nThe witness told CBS L.A. she took her phone out and got a photo of the woman, who appears to be holding a piece of concrete as her child stands nearby. Rodriguez isn't seen in the photo.\nRodriguez's grandson, Eric Mendoza, told CBS Los Angeles, \"I'm just overwhelmed how anybody can do this to a human being at all. He's 92 years of age. There's no harm that he meant for you to treat him the way you did.\"\n\"Mr. Rodriguez is slowly recovering from this senseless and brutal assault,\" family attorney Luis Carillo said. \"His family is appreciative of the community's outpouring of support and concern about his condition. The family has been inundated with media requests and is asking for a brief reprieve as they try to get back to a sense of normalcy. As soon as Mr. Rodriguez and his relatives are ready to share their story, we will make them available to the media.\"\nA GoFundMe page has been set up for the Rodriguez. A $15,000 goal was quickly reached. The total at last check was more than $316,000."

What if you don't want a Timeline that records everything you do on your PC? Too bad: Windows 10 now includes this and many other capabilities a large number of users will never need or want.\nDon't get me wrong. Personally, I love checking out new OS tricks, but I realize there's a vast army of Windows users who simply want a container in which to run their favorite apps.\nI propose that Microsoft's operating system become like the Firefox browser, in which you can add or remove extensions to get only the features you want. Maybe you don't want a timeline and would rather just have multiple virtual desktops (as I do). Just remove it and replace it with the appropriate module.\nI know Microsoft does provide a lot of leeway in turning features on and off, but a modular approach would actually let you remove the feature from your system, as opposed to simply disabling it.\nThere are of course problems with this. You'd have different capabilities on different Windows systems, so users and app developers could run into situations where expected capabilities aren't present. Somehow, though, web browsers still manage to run multifarious websites and apps, so the idea doesn't seem that preposterous.\nThere are rumors about a \"lean edition\" of Windows 10, but that isn't quite what I'm getting at. That flavor of Windows is intended for low-power, low-storage PCs, and removes advanced and legacy features such as the registry editor and Internet Explorer. I'm talking about making all the latest bells and whistles optional.\nThe macOS situation is no better, and possibly even less flexible. There, Cupertino decides what's best for you. Want a touch screen or a USB-A port on your new laptop? Too bad. Messaging and video calling? You can only use its products.\nLinux and Ubuntu lie at the other end of the spectrum: too much choice and not enough usability.\nMicrosoft actually already has a mechanism that could make this modular system work: the Microsoft Store. The company has struggled to get people and developers to embrace the store, even though it plays a big role in its future aspirations; Windows 10S Mode only runs store apps. Making parts of the OS available in the store would boost its profile.\nA modular approach doesn't work for everything. It's been tried for smartphones and laptops with very little success. But for a piece of software that many would like to run unobtrusively in the background, it could make a lot of sense. Those who like to tinker with all the newest features are free to do so, but let those who just want bare-bones serviceability have that, too."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Has a cute boy in middle school caught your eye? Asking someone out is nerve-wracking, but there are some things you can do to make it easier. First get to know your crush, and then move on to flirting. You can ask them out in person if you’re feeling brave, or with a text message if that feels easier.\n1. Talk to him casually about what he’s interested in.: Ask him about any books, movies, or music that he likes—maybe you’ll find something you have in common. You can also just chat about the classes you have together. Finding a mutual interest can help you form a connection.\n\nTry asking: “Do you play any sports?” or  “What’s your favorite movie?”\nStart up a conversation in the hallway between classes or after school.\nTry some playful flirting to build a connection with him and make him smile.\n2. Find out if he’s available.: If he’s already dating someone, or not interested in people of your gender, you can save yourself a lot of trouble by just being friends. If you’re not sure if he’s in a relationship, try checking social media or asking your friends.\n\nTry asking your friends or his friends, “Do you know if he’s dating anyone?” This will make it pretty obvious you’re interested in him, so be prepared for that.\nYou can also ask him directly, if you’re feeling bold: “Are you single?”\n3. Text or message online to get to know him better.: Texting is a good way to flirt with someone, because you’ll probably be less nervous than when you’re talking in person. You can send him memes that made you think of him or talk about your day. If you have contact with him outside of school, it will let him know you are interested in getting to know him better.\n\nShare a song you like or a funny meme.\nTry not to send too many text messages at once, and instead wait for him to respond.\n4. Decide if you want to date him.: Dating in middle school can mean many different things. It might mean you hang out with him with groups of people, you him text a lot, you eat lunch together, or that you hang out outside of school. There’s no one right way to date! It also might depend on how your parents feel about you dating.\nIf your parents don’t want you to date, try explaining that you will just hang out with him in groups, or that you will be back by a certain time.\n5. Pick the right time and place.: Try to ask him out when he’s alone and not surrounded by friends. This will reduce the pressure on both of you, so it’s not a big public moment. If you don’t want to ask him in person, message him after school.\nIt’s probably better not to message at some weird time like 3 in the morning.\n6. Plan what you are going to say ahead of time.: It can be stressful in the moment, so if you’ve planned what you want to say specifically, there’s less chance you’ll chicken out. It’s best to include a time in your question, instead of a vague, “do you want to hang out sometime?”\n\nTry to be direct to avoid confusion: “You seem really cool. Want to go out this weekend?”\nYou can also ask him to a specific activity: “Want to hang out after school sometime this week?” “Want to go get ice cream on Friday?”\nTry to avoid asking him to the movies for a first date, because you won’t be able to talk very much in the theatre. A dinner date might also be too much pressure.\n7. Give yourself a pep talk.: It’s okay to be nervous when you’re asking him out. It’s actually a good sign, because it means you really like him. If you’re feeling scared, ask your friends for support. Write down 5 qualities about yourself that you admire. It might help to give yourself a deadline to ask him out, so you don’t keep putting it off forever.\nPractice giving yourself affirmations like, “You can do it!”\n8. Ask him in person, when there aren’t too many people around.: Remember to smile and make eye contact. Start by saying hi and a casual question, like “how’s your day going?” Then move on to asking him out. If you chicken out the first time you try, just try again!\nRemember, you’ll never know if he wants to go out if you don’t ask.\n9. Ask him out with a text or a note if you’re feeling shy.: Write the note ahead of time and fold it up. Give him the note directly, instead of passing it to him in class with a lot of people in between. You don’t want the whole class to read your note!\nKeep it short and simple. There’s no need to write a whole love letter at this point.\n10. Be prepared for a yes or a no.: If he says that he’s busy, but suggests another time to meet, then that probably means he’s interested. But if he says no, respect his decision.

        "input": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.",

Then, you can use string concatenation and formatting to generate a personalized message for each friend in the list. \nTo ensure that the messages are sincere and thoughtful, you can incorporate positive memories or experiences you have shared with each friend, express gratitude for their friendship, and use language that reflects their personality and values. \nHere's a C++ code snippet that demonstrates a possible solution:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\nstruct Friend {\n    string name;\n    string interests;\n    string qualities;\n};\nvoid generateBirthdayMessages(vector<Friend>& friends) {\n    for (auto& friend : friends) {\n        string message = \"Happy birthday, \" + friend.name + \"!\\n\";\n        message += \"May your \" + friend.interests + \" continue to bring you joy and fulfillment.\\n\";\n        message += \"You are truly \" + friend.qualities + \" and I am grateful to have you in my life.\\n\";\n        cout << message << endl;\n    }\n}\nint main() {\n    vector<Friend> friends = {\n        {\"Emma\", \"creative spark\", \"inspiring\"},\n        {\"Sophia\", \"favorite cuisine\", \"delightful company\"},\n        {\"John\", \"love for adventure\", \"brave and adventurous\"}\n    };\n    generateBirthdayMessages(friends);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Friend` struct that contains each friend's name, interests, and qualities. We then define a `generateBirthdayMessages` function that takes a vector of friends as input and generates a personalized message for each friend using string concatenation and formatting. Finally, we call the `generateBirthdayMessages` function with a vector of three friends and print the resulting messages to the console.\nNote that this is just one possible solution and the exact implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements and preferences."

model that allows website owners to scale up or down as needed.\n- Public servers are highly scalable, allowing website owners to quickly and easily add resources to accommodate high traffic volumes.\n- Public servers are typically managed by experienced professionals who can ensure fast and reliable performance.\nLimits of hosting on a public server:\n- Public servers are typically shared with other users, which can increase the risk of security breaches and data theft.\n- Public servers may not be able to provide the level of customization and control that some website owners require.\n- Public servers may be subject to data sovereignty laws and geopolitical risks, which can impact website performance and security.\nBenefits of hosting on a private server:\n- Private servers offer greater control and customization options, allowing website owners to tailor their infrastructure to meet their specific needs.\n- Private servers can provide a higher level of security, as they are not shared with other users.\n- Private servers can be located in specific geographic regions to comply with data sovereignty laws and minimize geopolitical risks.\nLimits of hosting on a private server:\n- Private servers can be more expensive than public servers, as they require a larger upfront investment in hardware and infrastructure.\n- Private servers may require more maintenance and management, as website owners are responsible for ensuring their own security and performance.\n- Private servers may not be as scalable as public servers, which can limit their ability to handle sudden spikes in traffic.\nNow let's compare hosting on a public cloud service such as AWS or Azure versus a private cloud infrastructure such as OpenStack or VMware.\nPublic cloud services like AWS or Azure offer the following benefits:\n- Highly scalable and cost-effective, with a pay-as-you-go model that allows website owners to only pay for the resources they need.\n- Managed by experienced professionals who can ensure fast and reliable performance.\n- Offer a wide range of customization options and integrations with other cloud services.\nDeploying an e-commerce website on AWS, for example, can be done using the following code:\n```\n# Create a new EC2 instance\nec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')\ninstance = ec2.create_instances(\n

owners to tailor their infrastructure to meet their specific needs.\n- Higher levels of security, as the infrastructure is not shared with other users.\n- Can be located in specific geographic regions to comply with data sovereignty laws and minimize geopolitical risks.\nDeploying an e-commerce website on OpenStack, for example, can be done using the following code:\n```\n# Create a new virtual

vip['vip']['id'],\n    {'pool': {'id': pool['pool']['id']}})\n```\nIn terms of scalability, public cloud services like AWS or Azure are generally more scalable than private cloud infrastructures like OpenStack or VMware, as they offer a wider range of resources and a pay-as-you-go model that allows website owners to quickly and easily scale up or down as needed.

Private cloud infrastructures like OpenStack or VMware require more maintenance and management, as website owners are responsible for ensuring their own security and performance.\nFinally, hosting location can have a significant impact on website performance and security. Data sovereignty laws and geopolitical risks can impact the location of the website's infrastructure, and website owners should carefully consider these factors when choosing a hosting location. Additionally, website owners should ensure that their infrastructure is properly secured and regularly monitored to prevent security breaches and data theft."

        "output": "A well-written formal essay requires several components to effectively convey the intended message to the audience. These components include an engaging introduction, a clear thesis statement, well-organized body paragraphs with supporting evidence, effective transitions, and a compelling conclusion.\nThe introduction should grab the reader's attention and provide context for the topic. This can be achieved through the use of a hook, such as a quote or anecdote, followed by background information that sets the stage for the thesis statement. The thesis statement should clearly state the main argument or point of the essay.\nThe body paragraphs should be well-organized and support the thesis statement with evidence and examples. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that relates back to the thesis statement and provide evidence to support the argument. It's important to use reliable sources to back up claims and avoid logical fallacies.\nEffective transitions are crucial in formal writing to ensure the essay flows smoothly from one idea to the next. Transitions can be achieved through the use of transitional words or phrases, such as \"however\" or \"in addition.\" These words help to connect ideas and create a cohesive narrative.\nA compelling conclusion should summarize the main points of the essay and restate the thesis statement in a new way. It's important to avoid introducing new information in the conclusion and instead focus on providing closure to the essay.\nProper formatting, citation style, and language usage are also important in formal writing. Formatting should be consistent throughout the essay, including font size and style, margins, and spacing. Citation style should also be consistent and follow the guidelines of the chosen citation style, such as APA or MLA. Language usage should be formal and avoid slang or colloquialisms.\nTo improve each aspect of the essay, consider the intended audience and purpose of the piece. For example, if the audience is a group of academics, the language usage should be more technical and the sources should be scholarly. If the purpose of the essay is to persuade the reader, the body paragraphs should include strong evidence and examples to support the argument.\nIn summary, a well-written formal essay requires an engaging introduction, a clear thesis statement, well-organized body paragraphs with supporting evidence, effective transitions, and a compelling conclusion. Proper formatting, citation style, and language usage are also important to consider. To improve each aspect of the essay, consider the intended audience and purpose of the piece."

They were able to do Q1 on their own, they were able to independently understand ranges in python, and how to iterate over them, and create lists with ranges. What they couldn't seem to understand, is that basically copying and pasting the code from Q1 into the for loop would do exactly what they asked. \n\nI tried to present analogous scenarios to give hints, heck tie it to real life (\"you know how to make an omelette, what do you need to do to make 10?\").  They seemed to \"get\" these other things, but when it came to looking at code and trying to apply the same logic, they just straight up had no idea what to do. \n\nAfter a long time they were not able to grasp the problem, and I didn't feel comfortable literally just telling them the answer.  They eventually talked to another person who gave them a solution (not what they used) and that helped them finish their own independent solution that was 99% of the way there. After the class after the homework was due, they noted how they essentially \"face palmed\" after the professor explained the expected solution (basically copy paste Q1, as I described).\n\nI think part of the issue is that they have yet to cover functions, which would make it a whole lot easier: abstract away the Q1 part of the question, and thus make it easier for them to make that leap.  On the other hand I fear that I'm too far removed from the point where I had started learning to relate to their learning experiences (I remember when I didn't even understand for loops, so at least I know ",

Find the value of x{\\displaystyle x}.: Remember to follow the order of operations.\nFor example, to solve for x{\\displaystyle x} in the equation x+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}, first multiply, and then subtract 18 from each side to find the value of x{\\displaystyle x}.x+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}x+18=−4{\\displaystyle x+18=-4}x=−22{\\displaystyle x=-22}.\n7. Check your work.: To do this, substitute the values you found for x{\\displaystyle x} and y{\\displaystyle y} into both equations, and verify that the resulting equation are true.\n\nFor example, if you found y=9{\\displaystyle y=9} and x=−22{\\displaystyle x=-22}, substitute these values into both equations.\nSo, for the first equation:(−22)+2(9)=−4{\\displaystyle (-22)+2(9)=-4}−22+18=−4{\\displaystyle -22+18=-4}−4=−4{\\displaystyle -4=-4}\n\nFor the second equation:2(−22)+5(9)=1{\\displaystyle 2(-22)+5(9)=1}−44+45=1{\\displaystyle -44+45=1}1=1{\\displaystyle 1=1}\n"

In the short-term, fast food consumption can lead to an immediate increase in blood sugar levels, which can cause fatigue, headaches, and mood swings. Fast food items are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sodium, which can lead to bloating, indigestion, and dehydration. Additionally, fast food items are often low in essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies.\nIn the long-term, frequent consumption of fast food can lead to a range of health problems such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Genetic predispositions, lifestyle habits, and comorbidities can also play a role in the severity of these health problems.\nComparing the nutritional content of fast food items from various fast-food chains, it is evident that some chains offer healthier options than others. For example, Subway offers a range of healthy sandwich options that are low in calories and high in nutrients, while McDonald's offers items that are high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sodium. However, even the healthier options at fast-food chains are often high in sodium and low in fiber.\nTo mitigate the negative health effects of fast food consumption, fast-food chains can modify their preparation and ingredient choices. For example, they can use healthier cooking methods such as grilling or baking instead of frying. They can also incorporate more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables into their menu items. Additionally, they can reduce the amount of sodium in their food and offer smaller portion sizes.\nOverall, the short-term and long-term implications of fast food consumption on one's health are significant. It is important to make informed choices when consuming fast food and to prioritize healthier options whenever possible."

        "output": "1. With MS Word running, select File from the menu bar in the top left corner of the screen.  Then, choose New.  This will give you a choice as to which style and layout you want the document to be created in.\n2. In the search bar, type the word “screenplay.”  Currently, Microsoft offers one premade screenplay template for MS Word 2013/2016.  Double click on it after the search is completed.  This will launch the screenplay-formatted document.\nIn MS Word 2010, the steps are essentially the same.  Open a new document, then select templates, and search Microsoft Office Online.  Choose one of the two available, then download it.\n3. There are no hard and fast rules governing the style in which screenplays are produced, though there are general guidelines, vocabulary, and common features.  Check with the specific studio you’re writing for to find out how to customize your specific document.  Think about how to adjust margins, font size, fonts, and line spacing.\n4. If you’ve already written or have a screenplay saved on your hard drive, open it in MS Word.  In Word 2013/2016, click File > Save As > Computer.  Type a name for your template in the file name box.  Then, in the drop-down “save as type” menu just below the file name box, select Word Template.  If the document contains macros, select Word Macro-Enable Template.  Click save.\nIf you want to change the location where your template will be saved, click File > Options > Save and type the folder path you want to use in the default personal templates location box.\n5. If you’re unhappy with the template layout provided by Word, you can modify the style and formatting of your document in order to create new formatting patterns.  These patterns could be used again if you save them, or you can create a new template based on a document which uses these style and formatting rules.  You could think of formatting as creating your own template.\n6. The text might be a character name, a piece of dialogue, or some stage directions.  Select the line of text by clicking the left button on your mouse with your cursor at the left edge of the line of text.\n\nAlternately, you could highlight the text by clicking the left button of your mouse to the right or left of the line of text you want to adjust.\nFinally, you could highlight text by bringing up a blinking cursor within the text you’ve written and holding down the shift key and an arrow key to highlight the text you want to format.  To highlight text to the left of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the left directional button.  To highlight text to the right of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the right directional arrow.\nIf you have multiple lines of text, you can select them at one time and apply the formatting changes you desire to all highlighted lines.\n7. With your text highlighted, click on the word “Format” on the menu bar.  The drop down menu will display several options.  Click on the words “Styles and Formatting.”  This will open the Styles and Formatting pane.\nAlternately, you can open the Styles and Formatting pane by clicking the Styles and Formatting button on the toolbar.  Just click the Styles and Formatting button located next to the script character drop-down menu to open the pane.  The button is found at the far left edge of the toolbar.  It contains two letter “A”s, each of a different color, with one positioned above and to the left of the other.\n8. Right click on the still-highlighted text you selected initially.  A drop-down menu will open with a number of options.  The bottom-most option reads “Select Text with Similar Formatting.”  Click on this option with the left button of your mouse.  All text with formatting similar to that which you highlighted originally will become highlighted.\nSo, for instance, if you have all character names in a certain font and size centered exactly above a line of text, you can highlight a single instance of any character’s name, then use the “Select text with similar formatting” option to adjust all character names in your screenplay at once.\n9. After you’ve highlighted all the text you want to assign a given style, choose a style from the pane on the right.  The Styles and Formatting pane should still be open on the right of the screen.  Choose the style format you want to change the highlighted text to by left-clicking on it.\n10. If your highlighted text does not conform to an extant style, you can assign the formatting and style within the highlighted text a name by clicking the button near the top of the pane which reads “New Style.”  You can then assign a name, align the text to left or right, choose your font, and make other adjustments as you see fit.\n11. Typically in a screenplay, the master scene heading (also known as a slug line) is the series of words which broadly identify the content which follows.  For instance, scene headings might read “INT. OFFICE - DAY” (interior office during the day).  This helps orient the screenplay’s reader to the scene.\nScene headings should, as in the aforementioned example, be in all caps, two lines down from the last line of dialogue or description in the previous scene.\n12. A macro is a sequence of saved commands which can be executed immediately by assigning them to a single keystroke.  To prepare your macro, set your margins.  Format page margins by clicking on the Layout tab, then Margins, then Custom Margins. The top, bottom and right margins should be set at 1\". The left margin should be set to 1.5\". Set font to Courier New, 12 point.  These choices are standard in screenplays.  If you’d like to work with a different layout, set your margins accordingly.\nIn Word 2007, prepare to record the macro by setting your margins.  Format page margins by clicking on the Page Layout tab, then set the margins and font to the designations listed above.  Then open the Developer tab. Display the Developer tab by opening the office button (the top left button), Word Options (at the bottom), under Popular check Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.\n13. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for setting up scenes, assigning the name “Scene heading” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro.  This button is located on the left side of the developer tab.  Store the macro in Document 1 (instead of Normal, so that you can save it as a distinct screenplay template). Name the macro 'Scene' or 'Heading'. Click the keyboard icon to assign the macro to a keyboard shortcut.  You can then press the keyboard button you wish to assign to the macro.  For example, perhaps you want to bind F2 to your macro.  In the “Press New Shortcut Key” box, press F2 to bind it.  Click Assign, then Close.\n14. Then assign the macro to F2 (or whatever button you want to assign it to) using the “Press New Shortcut Key” clickable box.  Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\n15. Press Enter on your keyboard twice to skip two lines.  Go back into Page Layout tab (Layout tab in Word 2007)and change both indentations back to 0.  Open the Home tab.  Click on the bottom right corner of the Font section to open the dialog box. Then in the Effects section, check All Caps and click OK.\n16. Click the View tab again.  Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F2 (your shortcut key) will now skip two lines down the page and capitalize text, preparing you to enter a scene heading.\nIn Word 2007, go back to the Developer tab.  Click Stop Recording. F2 (your shortcut key) will now skip two lines down and capitalize the text.\n17. Description in a screenplay offers more info than does the simple scene heading.  It might offer details about the type of lighting, weather conditions, or other descriptions of the physical location of the scene and its characters.  Description is located two lines below the scene heading in a standard sentence format, with the first letter capitalized and a period at the end.  For instance, below a scene heading  like “INT. OFFICE - DAY” we might read descriptive info such as “The window is open and the lights are flickering on and off.”\n18. In the bottom right corner of the Paragraph section, click the little icon that opens the dialog box.  Set 1’’ indents before text and 1.5’’ after text under the Indentation section.\nIn Word 2007, display the Developer tab.  Click the Office button at the top left, then go to Word Options (at the bottom), then under Popular, check “Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.”\n19. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for description, assigning the name “Description” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\n20. Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro on the left side of the ribbon.  Store the macro in the same place you stored the other macro you created, and name it “Description.” Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F3.\n21. Hit Enter twice on your keyboard to skip a couple lines, then go to the Layout tab (Page Layout tab in Word 2007) and move both indentations to 0.  Next, click on the Home tab.  In the bottom right corner of the Font section, select the little icon which opens the dialog box to open it.  Look under the Effects section, then deselect All Caps.  Click OK.\nIn word 2007, after deselecting All Caps, return to the Developer tab and press Stop Recording before continuing with the rest of the above directions.\n22. Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F3 will now skip two lines down the page and be lowercase.  If you do not bind the macro to the F3 key, F3 will not be useful as a hotkey to setup descriptive passages in your screenplay.\nIn Word 2007, return to the Developer tab and press Stop Recording instead of clicking Macros > Stop Recording.\n23. Characters and their dialogue or actions typically follow the introduction and descriptive info which sets a scene.  They should be centered in all caps on the page with dialogue following on the line below.\n\nTo create a macro which will prepare you to input character names after writing scene description, repeat the same steps used to create a macro for description in MS Word 2013/2016, but:\n\na) after changing the indentation back to 0 during recording, press the space bar 22 times, then select the All Caps and\nb) name the macro 'Character' and assign it to F4. Be sure that the first thing done during recording is to skip down two lines.\n\n\nAfter pressing Stop Recording, F4 will skip two lines down the page (thus bringing the cursor to the correct character name position) and capitalize.\nTo create a dialogue macro for Word 2007, follow the directions for the description macro in Word 2007 but input the parameters outlined in the sub-steps above.\n24. In the bottom right corner of the Paragraph section, there’s a little icon.  Click it and a dialog box will open.  Set 1’’ indents before text and 1.5’’ after text under the Indentation section.\nIn Word 2007, display the Developer tab.  At the top left of the Word window, there’s a multicolored button known as the Office button.  Click it and go to Word Options (at the bottom).  Under Popular, check “Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.”\n25. Type a name for the macro.  Since this macro is for dialogue, assigning the name “Dialogue” to this macro is a logical choice.  Ensure you’ve selected “All documents” at the bottom of the drop-down menu reading “Store macro in.”\n\nClick the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F5.  Click “Assign” or press Enter, then click “Close.”\nIn Word 2007, click Record Macro.  The button to record the macro is on the left side of the ribbon.  Store the Macro in the same place you stored the other macro you created, and name it “Description.”  Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro a button of your choice.  For example, maybe you want to use F5.  Click within the “Press New Shortcut Key” and then press the F5 button to assign this macro to F5.\n26. Hit Enter once on your keyboard to skip a line, then go into the Page Layout tab and move both indentations to 0.  Next, click on the Home tab.  In the bottom right corner of the Font section, select the little icon which opens the dialog box to open it.  Look under the Effects section, then select All Caps.  Click OK.\n\nClick the View tab again.  Click Macros > Stop Recording.  F5 will now skip one line, utilize lowercase text, and prepare you to enter dialogue.\nIn Word 2007, instead of clicking Macros > Stop Recording, press Stop Recording in the Developer tab.\n"

        "instruction": "For someone who is new to play video games, what would be 22 key steps to get started?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Choosing a video game or learning to play it can overwhelm someone unfamiliar with them. Fortunately, the vast number of options also means that  there is almost certainly a game you love. With a little direction and advice, you can start exploring a virtual world in no time.\n1. Choose a platform.: Playing video games no longer requires a dedicated console or a souped-up gaming computer. There are an increasing number of quality games available for your laptop, old computer, smartphone, or tablet. Get a taste for these first before you shell out hundreds of dollars for a console or computer upgrades. Once you've decided to explore new territory, keep the following in mind:\n\nFor the largest number of available games, get a desktop computer running the latest operating system, and install a good video card.\nFor a cheap, easy to set up option, purchase a console. Choose a latest-generation console (PS4, Switch, or Xbox One) to play new games, or an old one (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 or even earlier) for a large selection of cheap, used classics.\nChoose a handheld gaming system for a specific game you can't get on your phone.\n2. Check the game rating.: Game rating systems vary between each country, but an explanation should be available on the packaging or online description. Games rated M for mature or for an age range 17 or higher typically contain extreme violence or disturbing scenes.\n3. Read the system requirements.: If you are using a console, you should be able to play any game for that console. Computer gamers need to find out their computer specifications and check them against the requirements on the game packaging or website. There are typically two sets of requirements listed:\n\n\"Required\" lists the bare minimum. If you fall short of any of these requirements, don't purchase the game. If you barely meet these requirements, the game will probably be slow and/or look much worse than trailers and screenshots show.\n\"Recommended\" requirements should let you play the game with shorter loading times, no lag or visual glitches, and better graphics settings.\n4. Watch video reviews.: Games are a huge business, and the actual gameplay sometimes fails to live up to marketing hype. Find at least one review before you purchase an expensive game, preferably a video one so you can watch the gameplay first hand.\n5. Hear about new games and old classics.: If you have gamer friends, you'll probably hear about new games whether you like it or not. Other sources of information include gaming blogs and magazines, which you can find with a quick online search, or browsing the vast collection of computer games on Steam, the free game store.\n6. Feel free to jump into sequels.: Don't feel obligated to play the first game in a series. The sequels often have improved gameplay and graphics, and often don't even follow the previous story directly.\n7. Be cautious with competitive games.: If you don't consider yourself a gamer, there are certain genres that you may not enjoy. First-person shooters, fighting games, \"battle arenas\" like League of Legends, and to a lesser extent sports games tend to be fiercely competitive. These are often extremely difficult for a new player to learn.\n\nIf you have your heart set on learning one of these genres, pick one with a single-player mode that lets you learn on your own, such as Halo.\nSome specific games in different genres fall into this category as well. The Starcraft and Dark Souls series are not recommended for inexperienced gamers.\n8. Try before you buy.: If you're uncertain about a game, look for a free demo version. If this isn't available, consider renting the game from the Gamefly website, or from a brick-and-mortar store.\n9. Play free introductory games.: If you've never got into a video game before, you might want to try a few free ones first to see what you enjoy. A quick search online or in an app store for \"free games\" will give you thousands of results, but here are a few suggestions you should be able to find in an online search:\n\nPuzzle games are easy to find in mobile app stores or online flash game sites. If you've had your fill of classics like Tetris and Minesweeper, try Loops of Zen, 3D Logic, Lightbot, and many more.\n\nMost free action games on mobile or online aren't great introductions to their more \"gamer\"-oriented counterparts. If you have a decent computer, Path of Exile is a more expansive introduction.\n\nIf you like strategy, try Hearthstone (collectible card game), Plants vs Zombies (tower defense), or Battle for Wesnoth (turn-based strategy). All three are available for both computer and mobile platforms, and most versions are free.\n10. Find more puzzle games.: Some of the biggest casual \"coffee break\" puzzle games include Candy Crush and 2048. Take it to three dimensions and add a quirky story to discover the acclaimed Portal and Portal 2. If nothing but the most cerebral and fiendishly difficult will do, play Braid.\n11. Search for action games.: This is a broad and popular genre. If you like fighting and platforming (leaping and climbing around), look no further. The atmosphere and setting of these games ranges from horror (The Last of Us) to family-friendly (Legend of Zelda) to historical (Assassin's Creed). If you like testing your reflexes but don't really care about story or immersive experiences, try a competitive first-person shooter (such as Call of Duty) or a family-friendly platformer (such as Super Mario Galaxy).\nIf you'd rather mess around or have fun with friends than explore and follow a story, try Super Smash Brothers (family friendly) or Grand Theft Auto (the opposite of family friendly).\n12. Play story-based games.: Enjoy sprawling fantasy settings? Play Dragon Age or Skyrim for a pseudo-medieval experience, or one of the more recent Final Fantasy games for the Japanese take. Bioshock 2 or Bioshock: Infinite are more unsettling examples set in utopias gone wrong.\n13. Pick up a few strategy games.: Build an empire with turn-based strategy in Civilization V or Civilization: Beyond Earth. Test your reflexes with fast-paced \"real-time strategy\" games such as the challenging multi-player game Starcraft II. Try any Total War game to test your single-player tactical skills or play the role of famous historical figures.\n14. Try games of exploration and creativity.: If you don't care about graphics, there are few games more appealing than Minecraft when it comes to building a world. Maybe controlling a house and family in The Sims 2 is more up your alley, or perhaps you'd prefer a more detailed world and atmosphere in Sunless Sea.\n15. Play a multiplayer online role-playing game.: World of Warcraft popularized this genre, in which you play online with thousands of other players. WoW is still around alongside Star Wars: The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, and many, many others. Most of these are partially free to play, but find out what the full version's payment system is like before you get involved. These games are infamously addictive, and once you're hooked you might find yourself spending a great deal of money on monthly subscription payments or in-game purchases.\n16. Learn to play.: Most games have tutorials that will walk you through the game play. If you prefer to learn on your own, read the instruction manual, or look for the \"documentation\" section on the main menu or website.\n17. Dim the lights (optional).: This is recommended for adventure and horror games especially. Besides a greater feeling of immersion, this will cut down on glare interfering with your ability to see the screen.\n18. Turn down the difficulty if you like.: Games don't have to be about suffering or pushing yourself to the limit. If you're playing a video game to unwind, set it to Easy difficulty. The harder difficulty levels are often intended to be difficult challenges for people who have played similar games for years.\nIf the game has both single-player and multi-player options, the single-player portion is almost always easier.\n19. Change the controls if necessary.: You can ignore this step until it's an issue, but if you find yourself hitting the wrong button or straining your fingers, visit the menu options. There's almost always an option to change the controls to whichever key you find easiest.\n\nA laptop trackpad makes it extremely difficult to play some games. An actual mouse is a big improvement.\nIf you like the feel of a console controller, these are available to plug in to your computer as well, if you have the right adapter. Not all games support this, however.\n20. Save often.: Most games have an auto-save feature that will save your progress regularly. If it also has the option to save manually, do so often. There's nothing worse than losing hours of progress because your system crashes or the power goes out.\nIf you have the option to use multiple save slots, create three or four and rotate between them. This lets you load an old save to explore a different story branch, or recover your game even if a bug screws up your most recent save.\n21. Explore and experiment.: One of the most appealing features of video games compared to other art forms is the ability to insert hidden content that you have to actively search for and discover. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of your games:\n\nIn platformers, role-playing games, or even racing games, try to move through or attack walls that look out of place with their surroundings.\nIn strategy games and action/adventure games, try new tactics even if they don't seem great. The later parts of the game (or harder competition) often require the ability to recognize when an unusual weapon or strategy has a chance to shine.\nIn games where you can talk to \"NPCs\" (non-player characters), use every dialogue option and read closely for hints.\n22. Get help when you're stuck.: Unless your only goal is bragging rights, why spend hours losing to the same fight or stuck on the same puzzle? Search for the game name and the word \"walkthrough\" online, and you'll find strategy advice or answers for every part of the game. If you prefer to solve it mostly on your own, ask friends or gaming forums for hints and advice. Hints and advice can make the game easier!\nIf it's not possible to follow the walkthrough advice (such as talking to a dead character), or if you are following the instructions but nothing is happening, it could be a bug. Search online for a description of your situation and you might find other players who can help you fix it.\n"

        "instruction": "Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what are relevant dimensions influencing the skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable?",
        "input": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

        "instruction": "Could you outline 16 practical steps to achieve tell your girlfriend that you love her?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Telling your girlfriend that you love her can be one of the most nerve-racking experiences you’ve had in a relationship. You’ll be tempted to overthink it, make crazy and expensive plans, or even tell her in a subtle way that might not come across the way you want it to. Instead, you should be direct and honest, trust your feelings, and pick an appropriate place to tell her. After all, if she feels the same way, then you don’t need an elaborate plan and you won’t need to find the perfect moment.\n1. Time your moment based on how long you’ve been in the relationship.: One of the biggest questions people have is when (how long into the relationship) they should tell their significant other that they love them. This, though, varies from men to women. One study has noted that men take 88 days to tell their girlfriends that they love them, while women take significantly longer. As a result of this, you need to make sure that you’re not rushing the relationship:\n\nMake sure she’s sent signals to you that she feels the same, even if she hasn’t told you that she loves you.\nDon’t tell her you love her during the first couple of weeks of dating. This is far too soon, and inappropriate. While there may be some couples who are sure of their love so early on, chances are, it’s not you.\nIf it feels too early, it probably is too early to tell her you love her. Wait a bit longer. If she feels the same way, it can’t hurt to wait a little bit.\n2. Tell her when you feel the relationship is solid, you are connected, and you want to move to the next level.: Perhaps the best time to tell her you love her is when you feel comfortable in your relationship and want to move it to the next level. There is no specific timeline on this, and it varies from relationship to relationship, so you need to gauge your own relationship and your comfort level before telling her you love her.\n3. Wait for the appropriate (specific) moment.: Telling her that you love her is not something you want to rush. You need to wait for an appropriate moment in which you’ll be able to express yourself and she’ll be able to respond. While you want to wait for an appropriate moment, consider:\n\nThat there is no “perfect” moment. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, you might wait forever.\nDon’t tell her when her complete attention is not on you.\nDon’t tell her when you’re in the process of coming into contact with other people.\nConsider a natural pause in the conversation after she’s said something sweet to you. This way, your admission of love will be a reciprocation of her own feelings.\n4. Wait until the two of you are alone.: Letting her know that you love her should be something you tell her when you’re alone. This doesn’t mean that you have to be completely isolated from everyone when you tell her, but you certainly want to have at least a low level of intimacy between the two. Consider:\n\nNever tell her in front of a group of friends.\nDon’t tell her when you are in front of your or her family.\nGenerally, the less people the better. If you’re alone talking in a crowd, that’s okay. But if you’re the center of attention in the crowd, that might be a bit awkward for one or both of you.\n5. Let it be natural.: If at all possible, you should let her know about how you feel in a natural way. While you’re going to probably think about doing it ahead of time, try not to script it out word for word and time it to the exact minute. It will come across as more sincere if it seems natural.\n6. Make sure you are sober and alert.: The best time to say “I love you” is when you’re sober and alert. There are a number of reasons for this. If you’re not sober and alert, you might botch the delivery. If you’re drunk or tired, your girlfriend might question your motives or think that you don’t really mean what you’re saying.\n\nDon’t be drunk and say “I love you.” Of course, a glass of wine or a beer should be alright (if you’re of age).\nDon’t say “I love you” after you’ve been partying.\nThe more alert you are, the chances are the better you’ll be able to convey your true feelings.\n7. Accompany it with a gift.: Some men prefer to give their girlfriend a gift, present it, and then tell their lady how much she means to him. This is certainly an acceptable way of conveying your love. However, consider:\n\nInexpensive thoughtful gifts that are homemade or represent something in your relationship.\nA necklace or bracelet (if you know she’s been interested in something like this).\nIt might come off as contrived.\nDon’t make your gift too grandiose, because it could seem like you are trying to buy her.\nTry not to make a spectacle out of presenting the gift, this could be embarrassing.\nOnly you know your relationship dynamic, so use your best judgement based on both of your comfort levels and expectations.\n8. Trust your gut.: Telling your girlfriend you love her is something you don’t want to overthink. If you overthink it, it might come off awkward or contrived. Instead, trust your feelings and your intuition. If it feels like the right moment to tell her you love her, then do it.\n9. Invite her to a romantic dinner.: A romantic dinner is a wonderful place to tell your girlfriend that you love her. It’ll set the atmosphere, give you both time to talk and enjoy each other’s company, and give you the opportunity to tell her.\n\nA nice restaurant that you both enjoy will work great.\nConsider a home cooked meal.\nIf cooking at home, try to set the meal apart from everyday meals you might already enjoy together. If appropriate, light a candle and put on some lite music.\n10. Invite her on a picnic.: Picnics are a nice of way of spending time together with an atmosphere that suggests intimacy but is not too suggestive. Chances are, you’ll both enjoy the picnic, and use it as a time to talk and bond more than you have already. It might create the perfect opportunity to give her your news.\n11. Tell her when you’re engaged in light intimacy at one of your homes.: Perhaps you want to let her know in the heat of the moment – when you’re kissing or making out. This works for some people, but there are some potential pitfalls you need to be careful about.\n\nDon’t expect sex. She could think that you are saying it in order to butter her up for sex.\nDon’t tell her during sex. This could come off as insincere.\nDon’t tell her immediately after sex. Instead, wait a few hours at minimum, or even a couple of days.\nMake sure it comes out naturally, and not as some grand sexual plan for the evening.\n12. Avoid telling her at sports events, parties, or movies.: There are a number of reasons why you should avoid entertainment venues for this sort of thing. Most importantly, her attention won’t be on you. But there are other reasons as well:\n\nYou both might be under the scrutiny of others, which could be awkward.\nIf she’s a private person, she might be mad that you shared such a big thing with the whole world.\nOnly you know your relationship and your significant other, so use your best judgement.\n13. Consider a grandiose moment, if you think it’s appropriate.: If you’re both over-the-top, out-going, and flamboyant personalities, then maybe you can consider a grandiose moment to tell her you love her. While this is not recommended for most people, it might be right for you – but ultimately, only you know your relationship and your significant other. If you are the type of person who wants to do this, consider:\n\nHiring a plane trailing a sign “I love you <name>” over a sporting event or some other event where you and your girlfriend will be outside.\nSending her dozens of roses with a card that says I love you. If you want to go really over the top, you can send this to her work. It might be inappropriate, though.\nThere are many other over-the-top ways of conveying your love, just make sure you think it’s right for your relationship.\n14. Tell her directly, at the right time and the right place.: If you think it’s the right time and place, just tell her directly, “I love you.” This is extremely direct, but it’s simple and it will convey what you are feeling. Of course there are a few ways to slightly soften this direct approach:\n\nSay something like “I have a confession to make…” then “I love you.”\nAsk her for her hand, and tell her you love her.\nLead into a conversation about how you see the rest of your life, and then tell her you love her.\n15. Let her know indirectly.: You can tell her you love her in an indirect approach, if you feel more comfortable doing so. However, be warned. While this might alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for you, it might take some of the magic out of the moment. If you do go with the indirect approach, consider:\n\nSpelling “I love you” on a mirror or another surface.\nSending her flowers with a card that says “I love you.”\nWrite her a “love letter” and snail mail it to her.\nUnderstand that an indirect approach could be construed as a grandiose admission of love, too.\n16. Communicate your love nonverbally.: Sharing your love in a nonverbal way is something many people do. There are pros and cons to this approach. First, a nonverbal signal of love might mean more than just mere words. However, it could also lack the force and emotion of a direct verbal approach. If you’re going to go nonverbal, consider:\n\nLooking into her eyes at the right moment. If you have a true connection, she’ll understand.\nHolding her and kissing her on the neck at the right moment and at the right place. Perhaps you’re on a beach watching the sunset. This action might say much more than words could communicate.\nBe warned that this approach might be considered a cop-out by some, and might not actually communicate what you want. Only you and your partner can know.\n"
