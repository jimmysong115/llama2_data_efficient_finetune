An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",

A prior study led by Orfeu Buxton, professor of biobehavioral health at Pennsylvania State University, found that just one bad night of sleep increases people's appetite for unhealthy, high-calorie foods. Another study, published this year in the journal Neurology, found that poor sleep raises the risk of stroke by doubling it over five years.\nZee said she is continuing her research on the role of light in sleep and plans to investigate whether women who don't get enough good-quality sleep are more likely to become pregnant with babies who develop diabetes or obesity later in life. She will also look at whether sleeping with light damages brain function and cognitive ability.\nIn another study, Zee and her colleagues are testing ways to reduce the impact of light on sleep. One intervention involves wearing goggles that block out light, while another involves painting the ceiling of a person's bedroom with a dark gray color. The third involves using an app on a smartphone to dim the brightness of the device"

We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

Through the symbolic power of this wind, Cather is able to show the reader how Mary is transformed by her move to the Midwest and her new circumstances.\nThe image of the South Wind also evokes a sense of freedom for Mary, as well as for the reader. The wind represents an escape from the confines of her small hometown and the rigidity of her upbringing. By following its course, Mary is free to explore the world and discover her true self. In doing so, she becomes a self-made artist, able to express her unique voice through her music.\nThe South Wind can also be seen as a metaphor for the natural world itself, which is full of beauty and mystery. Cather uses its presence throughout the novel to emphasize the importance of connecting with nature and allowing it to inspire us. By embracing the power of the wind, Mary is able to connect with something greater than herself and find meaning in her life.\nOverall, the symbol of the South Wind serves as a powerful representation of the transformative power of nature and the impact it can have on our lives."
