Use bullet points to break up long text into more manageable chunks, and be selective about which details are most important to include.

Use any extra details as supporting material in your speaker notes or handout.\nA traditional background design often includes a solid color for the background and white lettering.

Open these two branches in your editor or IDE. Now make sure both are identical. For example, if your local branch is at line 400 and remote branch is at line 399, add one more line in your local branch and push it to the remote branch.\nThis command will create a new local branch called \"merged\" which should be identical to both \"remotes/origin/develop\" and \"your-local-branch\". In my case, my local branch was \"develop\" so command would be:\n$ git checkout -b merged remotes/origin/develop develop\nNow you can commit and push your changes to the \"merged\" local branch.\nIf your local branch is already up-to-date with the remote branch (i.e., you didn't make any changes locally), you don't have to do anything. Just type:\n$ git checkout merged\nand you are done. You can now merge your local branch into the remote branch.\nYour local branch is now ready to be merged into the remote branch.\nLet's assume you want to merge \"develop\" into \"master\". Switch to \"develop\" branch and run the following commands.\n$ git checkout master\n$ git merge develop\nIn GitHub, when you try to merge a branch, it gives you two options - edit the diff and then merge or skip the editing and merge anyway.

        "output": "\nFair trade has its roots in the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Fair trading organizations were set up in Europe and North America to certify that products came from free laborers. The International Fair Trade Association has traced the origins of fair trade to the early Cooperative Wholesale Society founded by Roland Hill in Taplow, England in 1844.[3] In the United States and Canada, organizations such as the Student Christian Movement and the YMCA supported cooperatives in European countries as a way to promote better prices for farmers and workers. The first fair trade store was opened in Harlem, NY in 1968 by Judson Mills, who also worked with the Catholic Worker Movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, fair trade organizations became more widespread, particularly in Europe. In the early 21st century, fair trade became more international in scope, with organizations in Japan, Korea, and other parts of Asia.\nThe concept of fair trade is based upon the idea of mutually beneficial long-term relationships between producers and consumers, not simply short-term transactions. Additionally, fair trade organizations seek to address the power imbalance between producers and buyers. The goals of fair trade organizations are to: raise the standard of living of producers; eliminate or reduce the exploitation of producers; assist producers in gaining access to markets; ensure that producers receive the revenues necessary to invest in their future; and protect the environment and promote sustainability. Organizations also strive to empower producers through education and training.\nThere are many organizations dedicated to promoting fair trade.

The radio allowed for increased access to music as it could be broadcast to large numbers of people at once. This led to the development of new styles of music that were tailored for mass appeal. Examples of these types of music include Tin Pan Alley and Hillbilly music.\nNew media and technologies also emerged during this time that allowed for easier recording, editing, and distribution of music. The phonograph was patented in 1877 and began to be mass-produced by the beginning of the 20th century. It revolutionized the music industry by making it possible to distribute recordings of musical performances on a large scale. In the 1920s, the talking picture or \"talkie\" replaced silent films and introduced sound recording to cinema. During this period, musicians began to be paid royalties for their work, which had previously been considered an honorarium.\nThe performance of music became more visual with the advent of television and video recordings. The introduction of rock and roll culture in the 1950s made performing on stage even more important. Some performers such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles became extremely popular, selling out concerts wherever they played.\nMusic of the 20th century is often characterized by its diversity and experimentation. New styles of music called modern music were created, including atonal music, twelve-tone music, and serialism.

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

In summary, they are:\nAutonomy – the desire to direct our own lives\nMastery – the urge to get better and better at things\nPurpose – the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves\nI’d like to suggest a simple training challenge that addresses all three of these factors on Strava. My idea is to create an event called “The 50/12 Challenge”, where participants would attempt to ride 50 miles or run 12 miles in under two hours on a specific day. Here are some reasons why I think this is a good idea:\n1. Autonomy – participants can choose when they want to complete the challenge, as long as it’s within a month. They can also choose whether to do it on a road bike or a mountain bike, or on foot.\n2. Mastery – the challenge requires a reasonable level of fitness, but it’s not so difficult that it’s impossible for most people. By setting a time limit, participants have the opportunity to improve their performance over time as their fitness increases.\n3. Purpose – the challenge has a clear goal, which serves as a motivator. Participants know that they need to complete the challenge within two hours to earn the “badge” on Strava. Additionally, completing the challenge contributes to a greater cause, such as supporting a local charity.\nOverall, the 50/12 Challenge would be a fun and engaging way to motivate people to train while also addressing key elements of motivation as described by Dan Pink."
