It's like they took all the best parts out and replaced them with boring political intrigue and pointless subplots.\"\n\nI feel this way because I am a fan of Tolkien's works, and after watching the first two episodes of the series, I was hoping for an adaption that would be true to the spirit of the books. Instead, we get a very watered down version of what makes Tolkien's world so great, with characters that are barely recognizable from their source material, and a plot that feels like it's just going through the motions.\n\nBut perhaps this is the point. Maybe the showrunners realize that people like me are looking for a faithful adaption, and so they're trying to subvert our expectations by creating something that is not only different from the books, but also (in my opinion) inferior to them.\n\nIf this is the case, then I have to ask: Why? Why create a new work that is so obviously inferior to its source material? Why not just make a completely new fantasy series, one that is unencumbered by the expectations of fans like me?\n\nMaybe the answer lies in the fact that there is no such thing as a fresh idea anymore. Everything has been done before, and we know it. So when a new work comes along that tries to rehash something that's already been done, we can't help but compare it to the original. And if it falls short, we're bound to be disappointed.\nSo maybe the real question here is: How do we move beyond this cycle of derivative works, where everything is just a rehash of something else? How do we create truly new and innovative stories that capture our imagin"

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",
        "output": "\nThe researchers also found that when the young adults spent a second night in the lab with the lights dimmed, their bodies adjusted somewhat to the lower light level. The changes in blood sugar and heart rate were reduced compared with the first night. But both remained higher than they were when the participants slept in a well-lit room.\n“We know that sleep is so important for health,” Zee said. “This study shows that one aspect of sleep — the light environment — is not benign.”\nAni Manjikiani, an assistant professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, called it “very interesting.”\n“There are other studies that have looked at sleep and glucose metabolism, but this is the first time I’ve seen them looking at sleep and heart rate variability,” Manjikiani said.\nHeart rate variability refers to the variations in the time between each heartbeat. A person’s overall heart rate variability is influenced by factors such as age, physical fitness and emotional state. Higher overall heart rate variability has been associated with better outcomes, including survival after a heart attack and improved cardiovascular health after reperfusion of the heart following a heart attack. Lower heart rate variability has been linked to increased risk of death and heart disease.\n“It makes sense physiologically that if you have less variability, your body is not very good at recovering from stressors,” Manjikiani said.\nZee said she thinks the results could extend to all types of light — not just the light produced by TV sets and computer screens. And the findings likely apply equally to children and older adults, she said.\n“Light at night can disrupt circadian rhythms, which are important across the life"

Unfortunately, many small businesses didn’t have the resources to scale quickly to meet the demand for online shopping. In fact, an October 2020 report found that 96 percent of small businesses lacked an e-commerce website at the beginning of the pandemic. With more consumers making purchases online this holiday season than ever before, it’s critical that small businesses have a strong online presence — including an e-commerce store.
