The update, known as Windows 10 Mobile, will be available for free to existing Windows Phone 8.1 handsets this fall, and it will also run on new devices from partners like Alcatel, HP, and Lenovo.\nMicrosoft is joining the likes of BlackBerry and Palm by embracing the concept of a single OS shared across multiple device types. In this case, the end goal is to bring together Windows 10 apps onto phones, tablets, and even PCs. While you won't find touch-friendly versions of full desktop apps on your phone anytime soon, Microsoft has already announced that Office Mobile apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint will be universal across all Windows 10 devices.\nJust as importantly, the OS will support Continuum, which lets you connect your phone to a mouse and keyboard and use it as a desktop computer. It will also support universal tasks like taking a phone call on your PC or resuming a video on your TV that you started on your phone.\nAnd yes, Microsoft did confirm that Windows 10 Mobile will run on ARM chips, too, though it didn't offer any specific hardware partners yet.\nWindows 10 Mobile will support all the same key enterprise features as the PC and tablet editions of Windows 10, including support for enterprise mobile management (EMM) tools (including tools like Samsung's Knox), secure boot,"

Every attempt I've seen so far has assumed that the government will allow them to somehow do this without competition from PG&E.  I don't see how that can happen.\nAt the very least, you need to get past all the regulatory barriers erected by PG&E.  If you could crack those, then you would be in business.  The most efficient way to do this is to buy out a local co-op and threaten to shut down service unless they are allowed to join your new co-op.\nHere are some of the major regulatory barriers:\n1. You can't just build a power line and connect it to the grid.  PG&E controls where the lines go and who pays for what.  It costs about $20M/mile to string a new line.  They have thousands of miles of line.  \n2. You can't just start buying power from somewhere else.  PG&E gets preferential treatment on their purchases because they control the switches as well.  They also get a penalty if they don't use all the power they generate.  This means they have an economic incentive to generate more than they need.  If you start buying from somewhere else, they can sue you for damages and they can also cut you off.  This is why Apple's \"renewable\" program with PG&E doesn't work.  Apple signed a contract with PG&E to only buy renewable power.  When the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, Apple takes power from the rest of the grid.  PG&E generates extra power at these times and charges Apple less for it.  Apple pays about half of what the rest of"

        "output": "Why is it that parents in a wealthy neighborhood have more resources to put into their child's education than those in a low income neighborhood?\nThis question seems to be asking for a compare and contrast essay. I will try my best to answer the question as asked, but I will add some information to make it easier to compare and contrast.\nFirst off, there are good schools and bad schools within every district. The difference between the two is usually money. A wealthy school district can spend much more per student than a poor school district, simply because they have more money coming in from property taxes. This does not always translate to better results though. Some affluent school districts have high drop-out rates or low test scores, while some poor districts have excellent scores.\nIn terms of resources, the main difference between a \"good\" school district and a \"bad\" one is funding. Generally speaking, schools with higher property values have more money to spend than schools with lower property values. This means that wealthier families tend to live in areas with better schools, and poorer families are trapped in neighborhoods with lower performing schools. It should also be noted that due to desegregation laws, many school districts have a mix of students from various economic backgrounds. In these cases, the funding disparity still exists, but is less pronounced.\nA final note, education policy is a hotly debated topic among politicians and academics alike. While there is general agreement about the need to raise standards and measure achievement, there is no consensus on how to do so. Many people feel that standardized testing is a good way to measure progress, while others feel that this type of measurement is too limited. There is also disagreement about how to help struggling schools. Some favor privatization, while others prefer to invest more money into public schools.

        "output": "Given the platform’s new focus on news, it is an important time to consider how Facebook influences the spread of information.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the company is focusing on making its service “time well spent” for users, which may mean less viral content in their feeds.\nHowever, a new study from researchers at MIT and the University of California, Berkeley examines how Facebook’s News Feed impacted the spread of fake news during and after the 2016 US presidential campaign. The researchers found that false political news stories were more likely to be shared on Facebook than the truth — and that this trend continued after the election.\nThe researchers also found that the top 1 percent of false-news spreaders were responsible for sharing about one-third of all misinformation on the platform during the period they studied.\n“We find that false news was more novel, had more social media sharing, and was posted by accounts with fewer followers than the true news,” says Soroush Vosoughi, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and lead author of a paper describing the research.\nIn addition, the researchers found that false news was more likely to be backed up with no sources or nonsense citations. And they discovered that false news stories tended to gain traction soon after they were posted, particularly among Republicans.\nThe researchers analyzed more than 126,000 news stories shared on Facebook between April 2014 and November 2016. Of those, about 79 percent were true, while the remaining 21 percent were false. They focused on false stories shared by more than 126 million people.\nThey found that false news stories were much more likely to be viral: In fact, the"

        "input": "",
        "output": "By Krista Varady, PhD, CNS and Katherine Brooking, MS\nThe way we eat has a lot to do with culture, social norms, and economic factors. Making healthy food choices is not always easy in our society where fast food restaurants are abundant and the cost of fresh fruits and vegetables can be prohibitive for many people. But there are things we can do as individuals and as a society to change our eating patterns. Here’s how cultural, social, and economic factors influence people’s food choices and how this knowledge can be used to promote healthier diets.\nOur society has a love affair with convenience and speed. We want meals at our fingertips, ready when we are. This mentality has led to the proliferation of fast food restaurants. In fact, the average American spends 13% of their day consuming food away from home (2). Fast food restaurants offer cheap, high calorie food that is convenient for busy people on the go. These restaurants use fat, sugar, and salt to make their food taste good. Because of this, these types of food have become addictive, making it difficult for some people to eat anything else.\nIn addition, the relatively low cost of fast food means that many people rely on these restaurants for their main source of food (3). The cost of produce, however, is much higher than that of processed foods. This makes it hard for some people to afford healthy food options. Further, farmers in developing countries may grow certain types of crops because they make more money, even though these crops may not be the healthiest for us.\nEven if one can afford healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, different cultures have different tastes and preferences. Many people in the US live in “food deserts,”"

The Native Americans may have established trade routes with Europeans and Africans, leading to a more interconnected world. They may also have brought their own unique cultural practices and beliefs to the new land, which could have influenced the development of the local culture.\nHowever, there are also potential negative consequences to consider. For example, the Native Americans may have faced discrimination and oppression from European colonizers who viewed them as inferior. This could have led to the loss of their traditional ways of life and cultures. Additionally, the environmental impact of colonization could have been devastating, as the Europeans brought with them diseases and other factors that disrupted the balance of the local ecosystem.\nOverall, it is impossible to say for sure what would have happened if a Native American civilization had been the first to cross the Atlantic. It is possible that their discovery could have had a positive impact on global history, but it is also possible that it would have been overshadowed by the dominance of European powers."

Therefore, measuring brain dopamine levels would require the injection of extremely large amounts of dopamine into the brain to measure any change in brain levels. Also, dopamine is widely distributed in the brain and has multiple functions which vary depending on its location. For example, high levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex have been associated with reduced impulsivity, while high levels in the striatum are associated with reduced motor activity."

It is also about beautiful ideas that have deep meanings. One such idea is that of infinity. Infinity is a concept that has intrigued humans since ancient times. The idea of “something that goes on forever” is beautiful in its simplicity. And when mathematicians started to explore this idea further, they found that there were many different kinds of infinity. There is “countably infinite”, which means that you can put a one-to-one correspondence between the numbers and the objects (like the integers and the points of a line). Then there is “uncountably infinite”, which is bigger than countably infinite. For example, the real numbers are uncountably infinite — you cannot put them into one-to-one correspondence with the counting numbers. But there are even more kinds of infinity. For example, how big is infinity? This is a famous question that has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Some say that infinity is larger than anything else. Others say that it cannot be compared to anything else because it is completely different. One particularly beautiful kind of infinity is transfinite infinity. This is a bit tricky to explain, but I will give it a try. Imagine that you have a set of all the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …). Now we can create a new set by adding a new element called “aleph-null”. So far so good. But then we can create a new set by adding “aleph-null” — aleph-null is used to denote any object that is one-to-one..."

The only insecticides we had back then were made from crushed insects, which is pretty disgusting. Today we have DDT and other chemical insecticides that are safe for people and pets, but in the old days we didn’t. People used things like vinegar, boric acid, and even garlic to kill these pests.\nVinegar is a popular choice because it kills most insects on contact. It also leaves behind a smell that repels future invaders. Mix one part white vinegar with four parts water and spray it around your home to keep the hornets away. You can also make a spray by combining equal parts apple cider vinegar and water. This will work just as well.\nBoric acid is another effective way to get rid of hornets. This stuff is toxic to insects, so you don’t have to worry about hurting yourself or your family. Mix 1/4 cup of boric acid with 1/4 cup of sugar and put it into a jar. Put the lid on tightly so the ants can’t get out. Place the jar where you see the hornets and they will carry the poison back to their nest. In a few days, you should see a big reduction in their numbers.\nGarlic has natural insecticidal properties that can help get rid of hornets. Crush up a few cloves of garlic and sprinkle them around your house. You can also make a spray by mixing 20 drops of garlic oil with 2 cups of water. Spray this around your home to keep the hornets away.\nEven though these methods might seem a little strange, they do work"
