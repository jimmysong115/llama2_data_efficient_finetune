The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

        "output": "This can be due to a variety of reasons, ranging from a mild headache to a more serious condition like a heart attack.\nWhat does warmth do to your body?\nCold air can also dry out your nasal passages and sinuses, making it harder to breathe through your nose. When you inhale cold air, the airways in your lungs constrict temporarily, causing a brief sensation of chest tightness or discomfort. In response, your body begins to warm the air as it flows into your lungs by increasing blood flow to the area. This increase in blood flow triggers an increase in body temperature, which can make you feel warmer.\nWhy does my body get warm when I exercise?\nYour muscles require more energy than at rest, so they break down glycogen — stored glucose in your muscles and liver — for fuel during exercise. As this happens, lactic acid builds up in your muscles. The higher your intensity and the longer you exercise, the more lactic acid builds up. Lactic acid is what causes that burning feeling in your muscles. Your body then shuttles the lactic acid to your liver, where it’s processed and converted back to glucose so your muscles have enough energy to keep moving.\nScientists say there are two main reasons for this: one is to allow your body to maintain its core temperature, and the other is to prevent dehydration. Some people find they sweat more when they’re anxious, but this isn’t necessarily true for everyone.\nWhy we sweat when we are nervous?\nHeat stroke occurs when your body is unable to regulate its own temperature and your temperature rises rapidly. Heat stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Symptoms include a high body temperature, hot and dry skin,"

The elements are then connected together and analyzed based on their physical properties to determine the behavior of the entire structure. This method can be used to analyze structural behavior such as stress, strain, and vibration, as well as fluid flow and heat transfer."

As a native Arizonan, I had the opportunity to spend several summers living and working in Flagstaff, and my experiences there have left a lasting impression on me.\nOne of the most striking features of Flagstaff is its breathtaking natural beauty. The city is surrounded by towering mountains, including the iconic San Francisco Peaks, which rise to an elevation of over 12,000 feet. These mountains provide endless opportunities for hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities. In fact, one of my favorite memories from my time in Flagstaff was hiking to the top of Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona, and watching the sunrise from the summit.\nAnother aspect of Flagstaff that stood out to me was its tight-knit community. Despite being a relatively small city, Flagstaff has a strong sense of community pride and a deep connection to its history. One example of this is the historic downtown area, which has been carefully restored and preserved over the years. Another is the local arts scene, which features a variety of galleries, museums, and performance venues showcasing the work of talented local artists.\nHowever, Flagstaff is not without its challenges. Like many cities in the American West, it faces issues related to water management and conservation. Additionally, the city's location at high elevation puts it at risk for air pollution and wildfires. These challenges are exacerbated by its proximity to nearby national forests, which provide ample opportunity for outdoor recreation but also make it easier for fires"

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

Some of these include chronicling important events for future generations to learn from, preserving cultural traditions and practices, and even just for personal reflection and memory. Documenting history is an important part of understanding where we've come from and how far we've progressed as a society, and it serves as a foundation for us to build upon in the future.\nIn many ways, history can be seen as a continuous cycle of progress and regress, with each era learning from the mistakes of those who came before while building on the successes. By documenting the past, we ensure that future generations are able to benefit from our knowledge and avoid repeating the same mistakes. This is especially true when it comes to political and social issues, such as discrimination, war, and inequality. By recording and studying these events, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just society.\nFurthermore, documenting history allows us to preserve cultural traditions and practices that may otherwise be lost over time. These traditions often hold great significance for the people who practice them and can help foster a sense of identity and community. By documenting them, we can ensure that they are passed down to future generations and continue to be a part of our collective heritage.\nFinally, documenting history can also serve as a source of personal reflection and memory. Many people use journals, diaries, and other forms of writing to record their experiences and emotions, which can be incredibly valuable for understanding oneself and one's place in the world. By documenting our own lives and sharing them with others, we create a sort of historical record that can be studied and learned from by future generations.\nIn conclusion, documenting history is crucial for understanding where we've come from and how far we'"

Bush administration and is now a senior editor at The Atlantic. Frum has been highly critical of Trump and says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so you’d be forgiven for thinking Obama and Frum would have little in common.\nBut they had plenty to chat about. They talked about the breakdown of political norms, the media, and the current state of both parties. Obama didn’t pull any punches on any of these topics — especially when it came to the GOP — but he also expressed understanding for the challenges conservatives face, including convincing their base to support unpopular policies.\n“David and I probably don’t agree on much politically,” Obama said. But he added that he still values having conversations with people who see things differently."

Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.",

        "output": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?\nMetals generally emit light with a range of wavelengths when heated. The color of the light emitted depends on the metal's temperature and the wavelength of the light emitted. For example, when heated to a high temperature, iron will emit light with a wavelength in the infrared range, while copper will emit light with a wavelength in the visible range at lower temperatures."
