        "output": "\"The Rings of Power is an unexplainable masterpiece. It's so bad that it's good.\"\nThat review captures the essence of my experience watching this show. It's not a coherent story, and I don't understand many of the choices made in terms of character development, plot, and pacing. But I can't help but be entertained by it, thanks to the very talented actors, beautiful cinematography, and sheer audacity of it all.\nHere are my thoughts on each episode:\nEpisode 1: \"A Stranger in Rivendell\"\nThis was probably my favorite of the entire season. The characters are introduced (both old and new) and we learn a bit about Galadriel's background. My one complaint is that the scenes with the orcs felt like they were ripped straight from Shadow of Mordor/War. The cinematography was also beautiful.\nEpisode 2: \"The Ring of Power\"\nThey really went for broke with the amount of story threads they introduced in this episode. We got more insight into Galadriel's past, as well as the dwarves and their connection to the rings. There were even some comedic moments, which was a welcome surprise. This is the last time we would see Elrond and Durin until later in the season, though.\nEpisode 3: \"Adrift\"\nI feel like this was when the writers started to run out of ideas. They tried to fast forward through a lot of important backstory, introducing a whole new character (Celebrimbor) in the process. The ending scene with the Noldorin elves was particularly confusing.\nEpisode 4: \"The Great Wave\"\nThis was the first real clunker of the season. The only interesting thing that happened was the"

For example, hiring bicycles and exploring on our own would have made me happier than going on guided tours. If he doesn't want to chat about anything, maybe you've chosen activities which are too 'chattery' for him? Again, I don't know your friend so this is pure speculation, but perhaps he's shy or introverted and needs time to process things before talking to other people? Maybe try dropping some gentle hints that outdoor activities might be more up his street? \"Hey, I know you aren't enjoying the guided tours, but did you know you can also go sea kayaking in Abel Tasman National Park?\" (or whatever.)\nWhatever you do, make sure it's what YOU want and need, above all else. Don't feel pressured into staying together if you're just miserable.\nThank you for the suggestions - they're helpful to consider. It might be the case that I'm overthinking this.

Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.",

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

He also made use of mathematical concepts such as the circle and spiral in paintings such as Improvisation 31 (‘Concentric Circles’) (1911). The constructivists used geometric forms in their designs and sculpture. The artist/mathematician Sonia Delaunay was influenced by the work of the French mathematician Jules Henri Poincaré. In the 1960s, the Op Art movement employed optical phenomena in painting and sculpture. Software has been used to create mathematically based art since the 1970s. Workers have found many applications for fractals in the visual arts, as exemplified by the numerous prize-winning entries in the 2005 \"Fractals in Art\" competition."

This project took about 2 hours to make and cost less than $10 to build.\nStep 1: Cut Open the Can\nUse a pair of scissors to cut open the side of the can. Make sure you don't cut all the way through, or the can will collapse. Cutting a ring around the middle of the can will allow you to remove the top.\nStep 2: Connect the Pump\nConnect the air pump to the can using tape. The pump creates the pressure that drives the engine.\nStep 3: Connect the Whistle\nAdd a whistle to the top of the can to create sound effects. You can use any type of whistle you want.\nStep 4: Add Water to the Can\nFill the can with water. The water acts as the cylinder that the piston moves up and down in.\nStep 5: Connect the Generator\nConnect the generator to the shaft of the pump. The generator produces electricity from the motion of the pump.\nStep 6: Run Your Steam Engine!\nNow that everything is connected, simply pump the air out of the can. The pressure will push the piston up and down, rotating the crankshaft and generating electricity."

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
