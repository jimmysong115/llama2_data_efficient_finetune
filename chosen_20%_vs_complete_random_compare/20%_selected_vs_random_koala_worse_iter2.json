They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",

        "output": "What went wrong? How does something like this happen? The short answer is: phishing.\nThe attacker was able to gain access by successfully convincing a single employee to give up their credentials via a cloned version of our internal authentication page. From there, the attacker was able to gain access to a few internal docs and business systems before being detected. This happened very quickly and we were able to respond rapidly and limit the damage.\nHow did they get in? By phishing. As part of our investigation, we’ve been digging into what we can learn from this incident and will share more as we go. We know that this has been a painful reminder of how easy it is to spoof legitimate login pages.\nWhy didn't you tell us sooner? Right after we detected the issue, we locked down the affected systems, informed a small group of employees via Slack, and we began our investigation. We then waited until we had more information to share an update with all of you.\nWe want to be 100% transparent about this and apologize for not getting this out earlier.\nIt is worth pointing out that security is hard, and even though we have great people and strong processes, incidents like this are still possible.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

However, if you stay in the sun too long, you may begin to feel dizzy, nauseous, or even pass out. These are all signs that you are overheating.\nWhat causes heat exhaustion?\nHeat exhaustion can be caused by several factors, including dehydration, alcohol consumption, and certain medications. It is most common among people who work outside in hot weather. People who exercise vigorously in hot environments are also at risk.\nWhat does the body do to get rid of heat?\nThe body gets rid of heat through sweating, which cools the skin. When the sweat evaporates, it takes away some of the body’s heat. The heart pumps blood to the skin to help this process. If you don’t drink enough fluids, you can become dehydrated and lose more fluid than you take in. This makes it harder for your body to cool itself down."

Digital health tools can help people to track their health data over time, such as their blood pressure, heart rate, or glucose levels. This data can be used to detect potential health problems early on, allowing individuals to take action before they become serious illnesses.\n2. Digital health tools can also provide reminders and notifications to encourage people to take medications on time, follow a healthy diet, and engage in physical activity. This can help to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\n3. Digital health tools can also provide educational resources and support for people to make healthier choices and adopt healthier habits. For example, mobile apps and online platforms can offer tips and advice on how to eat healthier, exercise regularly, and manage stress.\n4. Finally, digital health tools can connect people with healthcare providers and other resources that can help them to maintain their health and well-being. This includes remote monitoring of patients with chronic conditions, telehealth services, and access to virtual support groups."

        "output": "What is a backlink example? A backlink is an incoming link from one website to another. For example, if website A links to website B, then website A would be considered a backlink of website B. Backlinks are important for SEO (search engine optimization) because they help Google and other search engines understand the context of a webpage. By analyzing the content of a webpage and the backlinks pointing to it, search engines can determine the relevance and authority of that page. This information is used to rank pages in search engine results pages (SERPs).\nWhat are SEO backlinks? SEO backlinks, also known as white hat backlinks, are links that are obtained through ethical means and have a positive impact on your website's search engine ranking. They are acquired through various techniques such as guest blogging, link building, and content marketing. Unlike black hat backlinks, which are obtained through unethical methods and can result in penalties from search engines, SEO backlinks are safe and effective in improving your website's visibility in SERPs.\nDo backlinks help SEO? Yes, backlinks are one of the most important factors that search engines consider when determining the ranking of a webpage. The more high-quality backlinks you have pointing to your site, the higher your website will rank in SERPs. This is because backlinks indicate to search engines that your website is authoritative and trustworthy, which is an important factor in determining its relevance and credibility."

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

The idea behind Duck Typing is simple: If it “walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck”. In other words, if a method or function meets the requirements of a certain interface (i.e., it “quacks like a duck”), then it should be considered a valid implementation of that interface even if it doesn’t fully match the definition (i.e., it “walks like a duck”).\n\nFor example, suppose we have two classes: Car and Truck. A truck may have a different engine size than a car, but they both still share the same basic properties such as being able to move forward and backward. Therefore, if we have a method in Car that takes an integer representing the engine size and another method in Truck that takes a string representing the engine size, then we can safely assume that the Truck class implements the Car interface because it “walks like a duck”."

I tried syching it with my AnkiDroid too but that didn't work either. Is there anything i can do to solve this problem?\nI don't know about Anki itself, but on Windows 8.1, if you get this behavior from any application, hit Ctrl-Shift-Esc to bring up the task manager, and then select the \"More details\" view. This will show you all the applications trying to communicate with the Internet (including many that have no interface of their own). Kill all the culprits, restart Anki, and hopefully it will behave itself."

Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.",

I cannot change the color of your skin\" (Adichie 109). Explanation: This passage supports the idea that racism and discrimination are prevalent in our society, even among family members. The uncle clearly wants his niece to believe that she is beautiful despite her skin color, but he also acknowledges that it is something he cannot change, thereby perpetuating the idea that skin color matters and people will be judged by it."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Most metals emit light when heated, but the wavelengths and intensity of the light depend on the metal's unique atomic structure. In general, metals with higher temperatures emit light with shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) and higher intensities. This is because as the temperature increases, the electrons in the metal atoms gain more energy, making them move faster and emit light with higher frequencies.\nFor example, when sodium is heated to a high temperature, it emits light with a wavelength of about 589.3 nm (nanometers), which is in the violet range of the spectrum. On the other hand, when copper is heated, it emits light with a wavelength of about 1.04 micrometers (one millionth of a meter), which is in the infrared range of the spectrum. As you can see, the wavelengths of the emitted light vary widely between different metals and at different temperatures."
