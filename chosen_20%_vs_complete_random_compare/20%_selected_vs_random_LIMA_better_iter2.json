The government funds some programs, which means that many people can get care no matter their financial situation. However, most health insurance comes from private companies, and not all of these plans are created equal. This means that it can be hard to figure out how to get the care you need or how much things will cost.\nWhat does the US healthcare system cover?\nMost health insurance plans cover some common health services. These can include:\nMedical checkups and immunizations\nTreatment for serious conditions, such as cancer or heart disease\nPregnancy and childbirth (if you’re pregnant, your health insurance must cover 100% of your prenatal care)\nMental health care and addiction treatment\nSome plans may also cover things like vision, hearing, and dental care. But you usually have to pay more for these extras.\nHealth insurance is not free. You have to pay a monthly premium to keep your plan active. And if you see a doctor or get medical care, you’ll likely have to pay deductibles and coinsurance, too.\nDeductibles are the amount of money you have to spend on healthcare before your insurance kicks in. For example, if your plan has a $500 deductible, you’ll have to pay for the first $500 worth of medical costs yourself.\nCoinsurance is the percentage of the bill that you have to pay after your deductible is met. So, if your policy has a 20% coinsurance, and your deductible has been met, you’ll owe 20% of the bill. The insurance company pays the rest.\nIf you"

However across the river in the neighboring state, the schools are among the best in the nation.\nWhy is this? Is it purely a matter of funding? Or is it also related to the people who live in these areas, or something else?\neducation united-states school district\nLiving standards are correlated with education outcomes, but it's not because of a causal effect of living standards on education.\nFamilies that have more money typically invest more in their children's education, both through private tutoring, as well as better public schools in wealthier neighborhoods. For example, see this map from the Census Bureau showing that higher income areas tend to have higher educated residents.\nAs an aside, I think this is another case of correlation vs causation. It may be that people who live in higher income areas are more educated because they have skills that allow them to earn more money. But that would be an explanation for the correlation between income and education, not why certain places have higher or lower test scores.\nIn general, though, when researchers control for socioeconomic status (SES), they find that school quality doesn't explain much variation in student test scores. So differences in school quality mostly explain the differences between neighboring school districts.\nTo summarize: There are wide disparities in educational achievement based largely on SES. This is not explained by differences in school quality (once you control for SES). Differences in school quality only account for differences between neighboring school districts."

By the High Middle Ages, membership in a monastic or military order was hereditary. The nobility of knighthood could be inherited, but it could also be awarded by the monarch. In the Low Countries, for example, knighthood was often awarded to settle disputes between noble families.\nThere are many stories about the origin of the knight. One popular one involves Charlemagne, who supposedly ordered his soldiers to remove their helmets so he could tell them apart.\nAnother story claims that the title was given to young noblemen who served as pages at the court of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. They were required to wear short cloaks, which made it easier for the emperor to distinguish them from other servants.\nKnights were expected to defend the weak and help those in need. They also had to obey the laws of chivalry. These rules included being honest, loyal, and brave.\nChivalry is an ideal that has been around since the 12th century.

Automation can lead to job loss, particularly in industries that are heavily automated. Prioritizing job creation can help mitigate this impact.\n2. Investing in new technologies and automation can create new jobs that didn't exist before, such as positions in data science, machine learning, and robotics.\n3. Automation can also free up workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks, allowing them to contribute more to the economy.\n4. By creating new jobs, society can reduce inequality and improve overall economic stability.\nPrioritizing technological progress:\n1. Automation has the potential to increase productivity and efficiency, which can lead to greater economic growth.\n2. Technological progress can help solve societal challenges such as climate change, healthcare, and transportation.\n3.

        "output": "Sure! To estimate the number of text messages sent globally in a minute, we need to first understand the definition of a text message. A text message is generally considered to be any message sent from one mobile device to another via a cellular network. This definition includes both SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages.\nNow, let's assume that the average length of a text message is 160 characters, including spaces. If we assume that the majority of text messages are shorter than this, then we can use this value as a ballpark figure.\nSo, if we assume that there are 4 billion mobile devices globally, each sending an average of 1 text message per minute, that would come out to:\n1 billion texts sent per minute\nAssuming that the average length of a text message is shorter than 160 characters, we could make the following estimation:\n2 billion texts sent per minute\nOf course, these are rough estimates and the actual numbers may vary depending on factors such as regional differences in texting habits and the number of mobile devices in use. However, they can serve as a rough guide for understanding the scope of text messaging activity globally."

These strategies can be used for a variety of financial instruments, including stocks, bonds, options, futures, and currencies. In this article, we will focus specifically on algorithmic trading strategies for liquid assets.\nThe first step in developing an algorithmic trading strategy for liquid assets is to identify the desired trading objectives. These objectives should be clearly defined and should take into account factors such as risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions. Once the objectives have been established, the next step is to develop a set of rules or criteria that will be used to determine when to buy and sell assets. These rules should be based on technical indicators, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and MACD, as well as fundamental factors such as earnings reports, news announcements, and economic data.\nThe next step is to design the algorithm that will implement the trading strategy. This algorithm should be designed to be flexible and adaptable to changing market conditions. It should also be able to handle large volumes of data and execute orders quickly and efficiently.\nAfter the algorithm has been developed, it must be tested to ensure that it is functioning properly and producing the desired results. This testing should include backtesting, which involves simulating trades based on historical data to see how the strategy would have performed in the past. It is also important to test the algorithm in different market conditions to ensure that it is robust and can produce consistent results.\nOnce the algorithm has been tested and refined, it can be implemented in a live trading environment. It is important to monitor the performance of the algorithm on an ongoing basis and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that it continues"

Internal combustion engine has an efficiency of around 20% while electric motor is over 90%. Using electric motor to generate power rather than burning gasoline would increase efficiency of the vehicle significantly. – user7015 Dec 3 '18 at 16:24\n@user7015 - nope, that's not really true. A modern efficient thermal electric power plant has an efficiency of 33-40%, while a modern efficient electric motor has an efficiency of 90-95%. They're roughly comparable. The difference is that the power plant is converting heat into electrical energy, while the electric motor is converting mechanical energy into electrical energy – Dave Jacoby Dec 3 '18 at 19:43\nYes, that's much more efficient, but you'd need to carry a lot of fuel with you, so that you could run the generator if you ever run out of battery charge. This is inefficient because of the extra weight. You'd need 2x the gasoline to get the same range as your battery. And this will make your car much heavier. You could use hydrogen instead, which would be lighter, but then you have the problem of storing it safely in a small enclosure. And then you need something that can split hydrogen into usable electrons & protons. – Russell McMahon Dec 3 '18 at 22:27\nOne more thing, like in"
