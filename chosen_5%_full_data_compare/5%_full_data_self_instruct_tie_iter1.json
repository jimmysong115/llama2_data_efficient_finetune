The architect John Carr was chosen to design the building after George III saw his work at the Adelphi buildings in London. The King wanted a seaside retreat where he could escape the public glare of London, so he purchased the former farmhouse used as a hunting lodge by Prince George, the future George IV, and demolished it to make way for the new building.By 1787, Carr had taken over complete control of construction from Henry Holland, who had been responsible for the original design.\nG70 is a high strength steel grade and has good formability, weldability, and notch toughness, which makes it ideal for use in structural applications such as I-beams, channels, angles, and tees. It is also commonly used in general fabrication applications such as pole line hardware, agitators, duct work, and conveyors.
