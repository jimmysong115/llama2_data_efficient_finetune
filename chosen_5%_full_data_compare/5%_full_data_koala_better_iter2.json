This is called the liquidity ratio and it varies from country to country but typically ranges from 10%-25%. If a bank holds more than this amount, then it is considered to be hoarding cash which could be used elsewhere in the economy."

For example, when learning about the forces between nucleons, think about why two balls rolling along a pool table will eventually stop, while they'll keep rolling forever on a trampoline. Or think about why a pile driver works: it's pushing down on the tip of the pile driver with much greater force than the tiny amount of force being applied by the nails going into the wood. When you think about what's really happening in terms of the strong force, it's much easier to wrap your head around."

Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems.

They also used to make you pay a fee every time you wanted to buy an online game, but now they've dropped that as well.\nEA is another company that's been criticized for being anti-consumer due to their strict controls over their games and high prices.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

The study was published July 9 in Nature Nanotechnology. The findings could lead to more effective and less toxic chemotherapies for cancers with high levels of KRAS mutations, which include most pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\nAs they have previously done with other types of cancer, the researchers first labeled gold nanoparticles with antibodies that target specific receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells.

Around 25% of all human cancers have mutations in one or more copies of KRAS, making it one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. The majority of KRAS mutations affect the G12/13 domain, which controls reorganization of the cell's cytoskeleton and modulation of signaling pathways.

I’ve been expecting you.”\nAnakin blinked in confusion. “Expecting me for what?”\nThe elderly Jedi set down his book and rose from his chair. “I believe our destinies have crossed before, my friend.”\nAnakin frowned. “I’m afraid I don’t remember you.”\nThe elderly Jedi chuckled. “Of course you don’t. Few do.” He motioned for Anakin to sit down. “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Valorum.”\nAnakin eyed Valorum warily. “And you are…?”\nValorum smiled again. “I am a survivor of the Great Sith War. A valiant Padawan, who lost everything due to the treachery of the Sith.” He paused, and his face grew serious. “But that is a story for another time.”\nAnakin nodded, unsure of where this conversation was going. “Well, whatever brings you here?”\nValorum gestured toward Anakin. “I sense that you are troubled by something, young Jedi.

Living in this beautiful oasis has been a dream for me and my family.   This city has many wonderful qualities that make it attractive to tourists and college students alike.  The first quality I noticed about Flagstaff was the beauty of the landscape.  With the San Francisco Peaks providing a stunning backdrop, every drive around town is scenic.  I love driving up Humphreys Peak for an astounding view of the town below.  I also enjoy going on hikes in the nearby Coconino National Forest.  It's always exciting to discover new places to explore.  Another great part of Flagstaff is how safe it is.  With a low crime rate and friendly people, this place feels like home.  Everyone here is so kind and easy going, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.  Although there aren't many big cities, there are still lots of things to do.  There are museums, restaurants, shops, and parks galore.  My favorite places are the Lowell Observatory, the Museum of Northern Arizona, and the Pulliam Airport.  One personal anecdote about living in Flagstaff is walking down Milton Road with my dog after a snow storm.  I loved seeing all the tracks our dog made in the fresh snow.

In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

The AU encourages member states to invest in up-to-date air traffic management technologies and human resources to enhance safe, secure and efficient air transportation across the continent,” the statement reads.\nThe union also called on the WHO to continue supporting Africa’s efforts to fight the pandemic, including sharing expertise, technology, and knowledge.\nThe union further called on African countries to work together to ensure that vaccines and other medical supplies are shared equitably across the continent."

So, the question is, how many glass panes are optimal to maximize the energy efficiency while keeping the cost under a certain limit? To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors:\n1. The climate zone - the amount of heat loss or gain through windows depends on the climate zone.\n2. The thickness of each pane of glass - thicker glass provides better insulation, but it also increases the cost.\n3. The U-factor of the window - the lower the U-factor, the better the window is at preventing heat loss or gain.\n4. The cost of the windows - as the number of panes increases, the cost of the windows also increases.\nTo find the optimal number of glass panes, we need to balance the energy savings with the cost of the windows. We can use a linear programming approach to solve this problem. Let's assume that we have two variables, N and C, representing the number of glass panes and the cost of the windows, respectively. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (measured in terms of the U-factor) subject to a limit on the cost of the windows. The constraints are:\n1. The maximum number of glass panes is 3.\n2. The cost of the windows cannot exceed a certain limit, say Cmax.\nThe linear programming problem can be written as follows:\nMaximize U-factor Subject to Constraints:\nN ≤ 3\nC ≤ Cmax\ns.t. U-factor ≤ f(N, C)\nwhere f(N, C) is a function that takes into account the U-factor of the window as a function of the number of glass panes and the cost of"

For example, Schmitt wrote: \"The distinction between friends and enemies is the most fundamental one in political life.\" Similarly, Voegelin argued, \"political order is possible only by means of a permanent revolution which preserves the essence of society through the annihilation of its existing order.\" The ethics of violence (which he called 'civic virtues') are essential for the establishment of such a new order. As such, it seems that Kahane's ethics of violence resonates deeply with the thought of Fanon and Zizek when discussing the American Jewish Establishment."

For instance, say my players managed to find and defeat a frost giant in its lair.

However, even if they had it listed in the basic D&amp;D 5e Monster Manual I wouldn't let them use non-magical weapons against a Frost Giant. Frost Giants are tough enough without making them easier to kill. The fact that Frost Giants have a high Constitution score means they are slow to kill already.
