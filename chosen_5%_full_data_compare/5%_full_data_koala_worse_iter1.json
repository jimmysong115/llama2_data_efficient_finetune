In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

Firstly, the film industry has historically been a male-dominated industry, and women have faced discrimination and bias in terms of hiring, pay, and opportunities for advancement. Secondly, there is a lack of female representation in leadership positions in the film industry, which means that there are fewer women in positions to mentor and support emerging female directors. Finally, there is a cultural expectation that film directing is a masculine role, which can discourage women from pursuing it as a career.\nJournalist: What can be done to increase the number of female film directors?\nDirector: There are several things that can be done to increase the number of female film directors. One of the most important things is to promote gender equality in the industry by ensuring that women are represented at all levels of production, from behind the camera to in front of it. This includes hiring more women in key roles such as producers, writers, and executives. Additionally, there should be more opportunities for women to gain experience and develop their skills through internships, mentorships, and other training programs. Finally, there needs to be a cultural shift towards seeing directing as a job that anyone can do, regardless of gender."

The two fell in love and eventually had a son, Kellin. However, tragedy struck when Kellin was just a young child and his mother died of illness. His father raised him as best he could, teaching him the ways of the ranger and passing on his elven heritage.\nAs Kellin grew older, he became increasingly interested in the mysteries of the jungle and its inhabitants. He spent much of his time exploring the area and learning about the various plants and animals that called it home. He developed a deep appreciation for nature and a respect for the balance of power between all creatures. This led to an early fascination with magic, which he hoped to someday master.\nWhen Kellin turned 18, he left Tamarind to pursue his dream of becoming a ranger. He journeyed to Absalom, the great city in the sky, to study at the famed Absalom University. Here, he learned advanced ranger techniques and studied arcane lore under the guidance of some of the most renowned scholars in Golarion.

When you buy a stock, you are buying a share of ownership in the company that issued it. This means that when the company makes money, so do you, even if only in a small way. The process by which you make money from owning stock is called \"dividend\" and \"capital gain.\" Companies typically pay dividends to their shareholders, and these dividends are usually paid out in cash. Capital gains occur when the value of your stock increases over time, which can happen for a variety of reasons such as good financial performance or positive market sentiment towards the company.\n1. Decide whether you want to buy individual stocks or mutual funds. There are two main ways to invest in the stock market: you can purchase individual stocks, which means buying shares of a particular company, or you can buy mutual funds, which are baskets of stocks that are professionally managed by an investment firm. If you want to buy individual stocks, you will need to research each company to find one that aligns with your investment goals and values. Mutual funds are more affordable because they bundle together many different stocks into a single investment.\n2. Open a brokerage account. Stocks are bought and sold through brokerage accounts, which are like savings accounts specifically for buying and selling investments. You can open a brokerage account at an online discount brokerage, like TD Ameritrade or E*TRADE, or you can go through a traditional brokerage firm.

The FEM is widely used in simulation and analysis of structures, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and other fields."

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun.

Firstly, the concept of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being is fundamentally contradictory. Secondly, the entire field of cosmology shows that the universe had a beginning, thus ruling out any god that created the universe. Thirdly, the entire history of humanity and recorded human interactions shows that religious people tend to be less moral than non-religious people.

We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by (x + y):\n(x - y)/(x + y) = 1/2\nx = y + 1/2(x + y)\nNow we can substitute this expression for x in the first equation to solve for x:\n$1000 = (y + 1/2(x + y))(1 - 0.015)\nSimplifying this equation and then solving for x gives:\n$1000 = y + 1/2x - 1/8x^2\n$1000 = y - 1/4x\nTaking the negative of this equation to solve for x gives:\n$1000 = y + 1/4x\nSo our man will need to save $1000 each month and his old car will depreciate by $1000/12 = $83.33 per month.

Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.
