        "input": "",
        "output": "Banks are required to maintain a certain amount of capital as a buffer for potential losses. This is known as capital adequacy ratio. The idea is that if a bank has enough capital, it can absorb losses without having to rely on external sources of funding such as depositors or shareholders. However, using cash as capital would not be an efficient use of resources.\nFor one, cash is a highly liquid asset but it does not generate any income for the bank. It also cannot be used to make loans which is the primary source of income for most banks. Furthermore, holding too much cash could reduce the bank's ability to take advantage of investment opportunities and this could have negative impact on its profitability in the long run."

It is an intentional lifestyle choice for those who want to live in a more sustainable manner and reduce their dependence on these utilities. There are many reasons why someone might choose to live off the grid, including concerns about environmental impact, cost savings, and independence from traditional utility companies.\nOff the grid living spaces can be created in a variety of ways, but typically involve using renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, or hydro power to generate electricity, and using composting toilets and greywater systems for sanitation. Homes can also be built with materials that are natural and non-toxic, reducing exposure to harmful chemicals. Additionally, homes may be designed to capture rainwater for drinking and irrigation and use food gardens to provide food and medicine.\nIn order to create a self-sufficient living space, there are several essential items that need to be considered. Firstly, a reliable source of energy is needed to power lights, appliances, and electronics. Solar panels are a popular choice for this purpose, as they are renewable and do not produce emissions. Secondly, a water supply system is necessary for drinking, washing, and bathing. This can be achieved through the use of rainwater collection systems, wells, or other methods. Thirdly, a waste management system is needed to dispose of waste properly. Composting toilets are a common choice for this purpose, as they reduce the need for water and do not produce foul odors. Finally, a way to generate heat and cook food is necessary. This can be achieved through the use of wood stoves, solar ovens, or other methods.\n"

By giving them gold, users are showing their appreciation for their hard work.\n2. To get access to exclusive features. Reddit gold gives users access to exclusive features, such as the ability to change their username, remove ads from their feed, and send custom messages to other users.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",

        "output": "We’ll likely close the AMA at 2pm PST (5pm EST), so please ask your questions ahead of that time.\ndeleted8760\nThanks for doing this! I'm still curious about whether the attacker was able to access user passwords or any other sensitive data (not just email addresses and such) in the course of the attack. Also, in addition to phishing emails, are there any indications they may have exploited other vulnerabilities? Is it safe to assume this is over now?\nEdit: You say \"as a result of a sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack,\" which makes me wonder if this was an inside job, and/or if there were multiple attackers and some of them successfully phished employees. Could you clarify?\nOur investigation suggests that no user password data was accessed. We’ve also done a deep dive on our production systems and found no evidence that any user accounts were impacted. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\nIt’s hard to say if there were multiple attackers since we don’t have evidence that anyone else was involved. We can’t assume anything about “inside jobs” because these situations are usually much more complex than they appear. That said, we have strong reason to believe this was a highly targeted, external attack.\nYou can safely assume this is over now. The system access provided by the attacker was removed within a few hours of the initial compromise, and we’ve been working full speed ahead to secure the rest of our environment since then."

The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement.

The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

Not only can they contaminate your food and spread disease, but they can also cause significant damage to your property. So next time you're tempted to give a mouse a cookie, think twice about the consequences."

        "output": "There is a common misconception that antidepressants can cause suicidal thoughts or actions. This is largely due to the fact that antidepressants are effective at treating depression, which is known to increase the risk of suicidality. However, it has been proven that this correlation is not causal. In other words, depression does not directly cause suicidality, but rather the two conditions share a number of risk factors.\nThis means that while antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidality, this is likely due to the fact that both depression and suicidality are caused by similar underlying factors, such as genetics, environmental stressors, and chemical imbalances in the brain. It is important to note that antidepressants are generally considered safe and effective for treating depression and other mental health conditions, and the risk of suicidality is still very low compared to the benefits they provide."

I'd love to hear your thoughts along these lines.\nOne way to accelerate into management is to look for those opportunities where you can manage direct reports early on in your career. For example, if there aren't any engineering positions available, look for an operations management position, or a project management role. Once you have some experience managing people, you should consider going back to school. You could do this at the local community college, or consider getting an MBA. The MBA will help give you a broader set of skills, such as finance and accounting and communication, that will make you more valuable to future employers.\nOn the other hand, if you want to go straight into management from undergraduate, you might consider looking for a job in a start-up company, or a small company that needs someone with energy and fresh ideas. Many times, a startup will need someone to wear many hats, including manufacturing management, so it's up to you to convince them you are the right person for the job."

Anakin tried to engage him in conversation, but the Jedi seemed uninterested in talking to him.\nThe two continued on their way until they came upon a group of kidnapped children. The Jedi ignored the children and walked past them, while Anakin quickly sprang into action. He used the Force to free the children and then returned them to their parents.\nUpon returning to the Jedi Temple, Anakin reported what had happened. The Council was surprised to hear that he had encountered such a strange Jedi, but they were even more shocked when they learned that Anakin had saved the children without the Jedi's help. They decided to investigate further and soon discovered that the Jedi was a Sith Lord in disguise. His true identity was Darth Tyranus, a powerful Sith who had been imprisoned by the Jedi centuries ago.\nDarth Tyranus revealed himself to Anakin and began to manipulate him, using his old-fashioned mannerisms and elitist attitude to make Anakin question the Jedi Order. He told Anakin that the Jedi were too rigid and closed-minded, and that he should join him in his quest for power. Anakin struggled with the decision, but ultimately chose to remain loyal to the Order."

Promote the waitlist through social media channels, email marketing campaigns, and other online channels. Use compelling language and imagery to encourage people to sign up.\n3. Offer early access or discounts to those who join the waitlist. This can help generate interest and incentivize people to sign up.\n4. Partner with influencers or industry experts to promote the waitlist. They can help spread the word to their followers and audience.\n5. Leverage user-generated content by encouraging waitlist members to share their experiences and thoughts about the product or service. This can help build trust and credibility with potential customers.\n6. Analyze waitlist data to identify patterns and trends. This can help you better understand your target audience and make adjustments to your marketing strategy.\n7. Keep users engaged and informed throughout the waitlist process by sending regular updates and communication. This can help build excitement and anticipation for the launch of the product or service.\n8.

This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application. Come up with a couple of ideas where Churned and Ocean can join forces, which we can use in the application\n",
