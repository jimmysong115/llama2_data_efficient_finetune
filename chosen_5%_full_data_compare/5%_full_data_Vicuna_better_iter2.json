Animal-based foods such as meat, eggs, and dairy contain more complete protein than plant-based sources do, because they contain all essential amino acids in higher proportions. However, it’s important to note that plant-based proteins can be just as high in quality as animal-based proteins if they are part of a well-balanced diet. Animal-based protein sources tend to be more expensive and have a higher environmental impact than plant-based protein sources."

        "input": "",
        "output": "\nAntibodies: They're in You and Me. Here's How They Work.\nTo understand how vaccines work, you first need to know about antibodies and how they protect us from disease.\nVaccines expose your immune system to a small amount of a disease so that it learns how to fight it without getting sick.\nA vaccine is an injection or pill that contains a tiny bit of a disease (a dead or live virus, or just part of the virus) or a substitute made from the disease that causes the body to create antibodies — proteins the immune system uses to fight infection. Antibodies are specific to the particular antigen ( Foreign substance) that caused your immune system to respond. After the antibodies bind to the antigen, they tag it for destruction by other parts of the immune system, such as white blood cells. The entire process can take hours or even weeks, and when it’s over, your immune system will have learned how to fight the antigen if it enters your body again.\nWith vaccines, you trick the immune system into producing antibodies without having to risk getting the actual disease. This process takes only a few weeks, compared to the several years it can take for the immune system to fully develop the ability to fight disease after contracting it.\nThe benefit of this approach is that once your immune system has been exposed to the antigen via vaccination, it can quickly identify and destroy it if you encounter it later in life.\nHerd immunity is achieved when enough individuals in a community have immunity — either through previous infection or vaccination — to make it impossible for a contagious disease to spread. When no new cases appear, the chain of transmission is broken and the outbreak ends."

Over many generations, this process can lead to adaptations, or changes in the traits of a species that make it better suited to its environment and improve its chances of survival.

The Aztec army was untrained in the use of these weapons, and did not have access to gunpowder or steel. The Spaniards also had a significant advantage in numbers, as they were able to bring more than 200,000 men to Mexico, while the Aztec Empire only had an estimated 2 million people in its entire empire. The Spanish also had a major advantage in terms of disease, as their horses carried diseases that decimated the Aztec population. Additionally, the Spanish had access to advanced weapons and tactics, which gave them an upper hand in battle. Despite all of these advantages, it is likely that the Aztecs would have been able to resist the Spanish for some time due to their formidable defensive fortifications and their religious and cultural beliefs.

His father died before he was born, and his mother remarried when he was three years old. His stepfather was a clothier who helped to educate him. At the age of 12, Newton attended King's School in Grantham, where he showed a keen interest in mathematics and science. He also studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1665 and a Master of Arts degree in 1668.\n\nIf Newton had pursued a career in biology instead of physics, he may have made significant contributions to that field as well. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that he was interested in biology and may have even conducted some experiments in the field. For example, in the late 1660s, he may have conducted an experiment involving the digestion of food, which would have been considered cutting-edge research at the time. Additionally, he may have been familiar with the work of Dutch scientist Jan Swammerdam, who was a pioneer in the field of microbiology and controlled insect development using electricity.\n\nFurthermore, Newton's interest in optics and the refraction of light could have led him to study the biology of vision.
