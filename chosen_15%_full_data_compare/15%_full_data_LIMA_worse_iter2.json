One solution would be to use a language model and fine-tune it on specific lengths of text.

These include the socioeconomic status of the students, the level of parental involvement, and the quality of leadership.

This is considered polite because it allows them to share what they have with others, and not wasting food is a great social concern in Japan.\n\nThis is so ingrained in Japanese culture that Japan has the word \"omae\" (literally \"self\") for the concept of personal or private possession. When you go to someone's home, you are expected to eat what they have prepared - even if it is something you personally dislike. If you refuse, you are insulting the cook.\nSo asking whether someone has any dietary restrictions would be an insult in Japan."

        "output": "\nNot all parrots can talk. The ability to talk is something that is learned by the parrots at a young age, and not all of them are able to pick it up. Also different species have varying degrees of intelligence and thus some might be more adept at talking than others. Each parrot has its own personality and intelligence level, so even within a species there will be variation in their speaking abilities.\nParrots do possess the capability of forming syllables and words, but there are limitations on how complex their vocabulary gets. This is because they lack the cognitive abilities to form abstract concepts and cannot create new words from scratch. However, some parrots with high intelligence can learn to mimic human speech quite accurately.\nIn summary, while parrots have the capacity to learn language, their talking abilities vary depending on their individual personalities, species, and level of intelligence.

People can now access a vast array of news sources, from traditional media outlets to blogs and social media posts, all in one place. This has led to a fragmentation of the news landscape, with people consuming news from a variety of sources rather than relying on a single source.\nOne potential implication of this fragmentation is that it can make it easier for misinformation to spread. People may be more likely to encounter false or biased information from sources they don't trust or know, and may not have the skills to identify false information. Additionally, social media algorithms can amplify extreme views and polarizing content, which can further divide audiences and make it easier for misinformation to spread.\nAnother potential implication is that social media platforms can create echo chambers, where people only encounter news that confirms their existing beliefs and values. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and a distrust of diverse perspectives. Additionally, social media platforms may prioritize sensationalism and clickbait content over substantive reporting, which can further contribute to the spread of misinformation.\nTo mitigate these implications, social media platforms can take steps to promote trustworthy sources of news, such as fact-checking organizations and reliable news outlets. They can also provide tools for users to flag false information and report abusive behavior. Additionally, platforms can prioritize diverse perspectives and encourage civil discourse to promote a more informed and inclusive community."

        "output": "\nCultural, social, and economic factors play a significant role in shaping people's food choices. For example, in some cultures, traditional foods are highly valued and passed down from generation to generation, making them an important part of the cultural identity. In other cases, food may be used as a means of socialization, with people gathering around the table to share meals and build relationships. Economic factors such as affordability, availability, and accessibility can also influence food choices, with less expensive and readily available options often being chosen over more healthful options.\nTo promote healthier diets, it is important to understand how these cultural, social, and economic factors influence food choices. This knowledge can be used to develop effective interventions and policies that support healthier eating habits. For example, policies that invest in local agriculture and increase access to fresh, nutritious foods can help address economic barriers to healthy eating. Additionally, community-based initiatives that promote cultural traditions and celebrate diverse culinary practices can foster a sense of pride and identity in healthier eating habits. Finally, social marketing campaigns that highlight the benefits of healthy eating and provide practical tips for making healthier food choices can help shift societal norms and encourage individuals to make positive changes to their diets."

But no matter how great the obstacle, Galahad never faltered in his mission.\nAfter many long days and nights of travel, Galahad arrived at the castle of the evil king who was leading the forces against Camelot. The king was a powerful sorcerer, with magical powers that seemed unstoppable. But Galahad was undaunted, and he fought valiantly against the sorcerer, eventually defeating him and saving Camelot from destruction.\nGalahad's bravery and sacrifice were not in vain. The world was saved from the evil forces, and Camelot was restored to its former glory. And though Galahad never expected any reward for his actions, he was celebrated as a hero throughout the land for his selflessness and courage."

Finding that Crimea is part of Russia would not only be consistent with both history and international law.\nCrimea is a peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014. This region was annexed by the Russian Federation despite the protests of the West. Many people assert that Crimea belongs to Ukraine, while others say it is Russian territory.\nEveryone knows the origins of this conflict: after the February coup in Kiev, which ousted democratically elected president Victor Yanukovich and installed a pro-European Union government, Crimea, which had long enjoyed considerable autonomy within Ukraine, voted overwhelmingly (97 percent) to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia.\nIn March 2014, following an armed takeover of state buildings in several Ukrainian cities, including Crimea's capital, Simferopol, Russia recognised the independence and sovereignty of Crimea following a referendum. The referendum results showed an overwhelming majority of Crimeans in favour of both joining the Russian Federation and of retaining the use of the Russian language. All these events were either ignored or justified, depending on the political position of the speaker.\nOn April 16th, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 declared that the referendum held in Crimea, on March 16th, 2014, was not in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution and could have no precedent value. In other words, the UN did not consider Crimea to be part of Russia because they didn't like the result of a popular vote.\nSo Crimea is a disputed territory and its status remains"

This would require developing some new technology beyond what we have today, such as the ability to transmit messages at rates much faster than the speed of light. Once we’ve established communication, we need to be able to understand what they are saying. This means developing extremely sophisticated AI systems that can translate the messages into something meaningful for us. It’s not clear if this is even possible. Finally, even if we can communicate with them, we need to determine whether they are friendly or hostile. Again, this requires advanced AI systems that can assess the situation and make decisions based on complex criteria.

One of the main reason is history. If you look at the colonization history of Asian countries by European and American powers in 19th and 20th century, this has left its mark in the education system and cultural influence. For example, India was colonized by British for almost 2 centuries, which is reflected in their educational curriculum and choice of medium of instruction in schools even today. Also, most of the trade deals and diplomatic ties are conducted mostly in English. So, if you are from India - learning English gets you a long way in terms of career opportunities. Same applies for Philippines, Indonesia, etc.\nOn the other hand, China, Korea, Japan have not had similar historical experiences, except maybe some years during WWII where Japan occupied parts of East Asia. This means that English is not as necessary or preferred for them to use it as a lingua franca and China in particular, has been making efforts to promote their languages rather than using English.\nAnother interesting fact is that number of native speakers of English is around "

On the other hand, if you were to rent a 3k/month apartment, your total cost would be about 140k over the 5 year period.\nSo financially, buying a condo makes more sense. But, we need to take into consideration other factors like time and flexibility. The process of buying a home is long and tedious, which might not work well with your schedule. Also, if you do decide to move, you will have to sell your place, whereas if you are renting, you can just move out.

If you can do that, then even if the bias exists (which I hope you can overcome), it will not affect your performance. As for finding a thesis adviser, I think you need to show that you can produce quality work, which means strong grades in your classes as well as good recommendations from your professors.

Some of the signs of secondary trauma include being easily startled, avoiding talking about the case or the job in general, becoming more emotionally numb, intrusive thoughts of the crime scene, and trouble sleeping. It is important for detectives to learn healthy coping strategies as a way to help prevent secondary traumatic stress. One helpful strategy is mindfulness meditation to help them stay present in the moment and reframe their distressing thoughts concerning the crime scene.\nIt is not uncommon for homicide detectives to experience some form of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) after investigating violent crimes. They may have nightmares, flashbacks, and feel emotionally numb. Some may even engage in self-destructive behavior such as substance abuse. Often times, these symptoms go unnoticed and untreated. This can lead to complications in both their professional and personal lives. There are, however, many ways that homicide detectives can cope with the stress of their job.\nDetectives may want to consider different methods of relaxation such as mindfulness meditation or yoga. Mindfulness meditation is a very useful tool for helping first responders manage stress and trauma. It helps to be mindful of one's thoughts and feelings, rather than getting lost in them.

        "output": "\nIt’s common to hear beginning musicians complain that the musical scale is too difficult to learn. Certainly, it is more difficult than it would appear at first glance: seven keys are major and five are minor. In what follows, I will try to explain how this came about.\nThe musical scale, as we know it today, was forged during the baroque period, roughly between 1600 and 1750. The scale of that time had 12 chromatic notes plus two “dead” notes. The two dead notes were B-flat and D-sharp. (These notes have since been brought into the scale by means of a small change in the key signature, reducing the number of sharps or flats in that signature by one.) In the baroque scale, these two notes sounded very different from the other 10. Today they are indistinguishable from them; in fact, they are identical except for their names. That is why the scale has only 12 notes today, instead of 14.\nThe origins of western music can be traced back to the middle ages, around the year 1000. At that time, no such thing as a standard scale existed. Each composer invented his own scale, which could vary widely from one composition to another.\nAs an example, consider the scale used in Gregorian chants, which were sung throughout Western Europe at that time. It consisted of eight tones and was built on a repeating pattern of three tones followed by a semitone, followed again by three tones and so on. For example, starting on C, the pattern would be C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. This creates a sequence of eight different notes. Three examples of this are shown below.\nNotice that the pattern starts with a"

If you had a conversation with this person that you wanted to keep confidential, then you shouldn't have spoken where you couldn't control who overheard. – Brandin Jul 12 '18 at 16:37\nIt is (or should be) obvious that employees need to be able to trust their managers. If you accept your employee's explanation for recording the conversation, then you will have lost some of your employee's trust in you as a manager. If you fire him, you may lose the rest of his trust. You must decide which is more important to you. Depending on the content of the conversation, firing him might not be appropriate, even if you are otherwise entitled to do so. – user6726 Jun 10 at 15:43\nThere's a difference between \"recording\" and \"listening\". The employee could have been jotting down notes about the conversation. Either way, you can't dictate what your employees do while they're off-duty, unless you have a policy prohibiting such behavior and clearly communicated it (and maybe even then). I don't know what state you're in, but there are laws prohibiting employers from doing just that. – Lilienthal♦ Jun 11 '18 at 17:09\nIn my state (New York), it would be legal to fire an employee for doing that.

He doesn't need to risk his life to be a hero, and that doesn't make him less of a hero.\nThe question of what makes a hero is complex, but its not related to whether a character faces risk or not. Ask yourself this: would you consider someone who saves lives from a bomb as a 'hero', if they get paid for doing it? That person is saving lives, but they are not risking their own. How about a fireman? They go into burning buildings, but they are trained to do so, and have backup if needed.

        "output": " nobody can tell me that.\nSure, I’d be happy to help! 🙂\nNewton’s first law is also known as the law of inertia. It states that a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion remains in motion at constant velocity in a straight line unless an external force acts upon it. This means that if you leave a box on the floor, it will stay where it is. If you push a box, it will start moving and keep going until something stops it.\nNewton’s second law is also known as the law of acceleration. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass. In other words, if you apply more force to an object, it accelerates faster. If you double the force, the object doubles its acceleration. And if you triple the force, the object triples its acceleration. The mass of the object determines how much force is needed to get it moving or to change its momentum. A heavy object takes more force to get moving than a light object.\nNewton’s third law is also known as the law of action-reaction. It states that for every action (force) there is an equal and opposite reaction (force). In other words, when you push on an object, the object pushes back just as hard. When you step on the brakes in your car, the brakes push back on the tires, which slow down the wheels and the car."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Nationalists and populists have always tried to use available technologies to spread their message. In the 1930’s, it was radio that provided them with a platform to reach out to the masses. Today, social media (and in particular Twitter) is used by many nationalist groups. The question is whether this is simply a matter of technology changing or there are deeper parallels between the two eras.\nIn the past, I have argued elsewhere that the link between nationalism and populism is overstated. Nationalists are often anti-elitist, but they do not necessarily support policies that are anti-establishment. Populists on the other hand can be either nationalists or anti-establishment. Geert Wilders fits quite well in the populist camp whereas Marine Le Pen is more of a nationalist.\nHowever, when looking at the use of social media, both nationalists and populists make use of it, although there may be differences between them.\nIn a recent paper, Cas Mudde analyses how populists make use of Twitter. They often follow a similar strategy: they tweet a lot, mostly about current affairs where they take a strong stand. The content of these tweets is very similar to the content of their party manifestos. This shows that populists are indeed using social media to spread their message.\nIn an article in Dutch newspaper Trouw, journalist Joost Oranje argues that the same is true for nationalists. He spoke to Jeroen Gelsing, who teaches new media at the University of Amsterdam, and asked him to analyse the accounts of nationalist leader Thierry Baudet and his party FvD. According to Gelsing, Baudet uses Twitter in a similar way as populists do, except that he does not criticise existing political institutions and politicians as much. Instead, he focuses"

The problem is that most of the discussions that take place are not documented anywhere, and new employees struggle to keep up with the existing team because of this. They have to spend a lot of time reading through all the past messages to get up to speed.\nI believe it's better to use documentation like Confluence or Google Docs instead, as it provides a permanent record of the discussions, and it's easier for new team members to come in and get up to speed quickly. However, my colleagues don't agree with me, and I'm struggling to convince them otherwise.\nHow can I convince people that the use of instant messaging platforms like Slack, and Hipchat are not a good substitute for documentation?\n\nThis type of situation is what has given rise to the concept of \"knowledge silos\".\nIn your case, you have a wealth of knowledge that is only accessible by those who were there when it was created. This is a big problem because if you were to lose one of these team members, their knowledge would be gone forever. It also means that no one else on the team can contribute to the discussion without having read all of the previous messages, which makes it hard to collaborate.\nA centralized documentation system solves all of these problems. It avoids the issue of knowledge silos by providing an easily accessible repository of all the information that your team has generated. It creates an environment where anyone can easily (and encouraged to) contribute to the knowledge base. You can also reap the benefits of version control, which helps ensure that no one ever loses track of what was decided."
