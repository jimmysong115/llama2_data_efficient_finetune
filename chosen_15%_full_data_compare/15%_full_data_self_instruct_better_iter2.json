It’s not only highly addictive and gripping, but it pays attention to the smallest of details in storytelling and character development. When I recently decided to make a review of every season, I knew that I wanted to start with the first, as it is most often considered the “worst” of the bunch, even though I don’t think it is at all. This is mainly due to the fact that nothing happens in this season, that it mostly acts as a set-up. I always found this to be a bit unfair, because while it does act as a set-up, it also has some fantastic storytelling within itself, and sets up everything brilliantly.\nBreaking Bad (TV Series 2008–2013) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\nBreaking Bad (TV Series 2008–2013) cast and crew credits, including actors, actresses, directors, writers and more.\nBreaking Bad Season 1 Episode 1 Review - YouTube\n4/11/2017 · Breaking Bad: Season 1 Review.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
