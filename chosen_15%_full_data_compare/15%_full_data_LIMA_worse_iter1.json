Abstract: This paper offers a non-myopic model of economic growth in which the returns to education are the key to understanding long-term growth. The model posits that the returns to education increase with the level of development such that developing countries benefit from investing in skills today. This is consistent with empirical evidence showing that income elasticity of education demand is higher in poorer countries. To illustrate this point, we conduct a dynamic general equilibrium analysis of a small open economy with endogenous human capital accumulation. We find that the model generates quantitatively important long-run growth effects from education policies.\nThe Lottery Ticket Hypothesis - Investopedia\nThe lottery ticket hypothesis states that an underperforming asset or company has the potential for big gains if certain conditions are met. Underperforming assets may include stocks with low current prices relative to their historical averages and companies with strong fundamentals that have recently experienced temporary challenges.\nLottery Ticket Hypothesis | Economics Help\nThis paper offers a non-myopic model of economic growth in which the returns to education are the key to understanding long-term growth.

But the more I read about some of the other bills in the 113th Congress, the more I worry about how they might be used against us.\nConsider HR 965, for example. It's called the SAFE Act or Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act. The bill title is a total lie. It has nothing to do with public lands recreation or firearms safety. All it really does is open up federal lands to more hunting and fishing. That should be fine with most sportsmen, but it seems like a transparent attempt to slip legislation past us that we wouldn't otherwise support.\nI also noticed that the bill has over 200 co-sponsors, including Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore), who spearheaded the effort in the last session of Congress to pass HR 822, the so-called \"National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act.\" Maybe that bill was just an innocent mistake; maybe he's a hunter and doesn't know any better. Or maybe these bills are being passed by stealth.\nIf you look at the list of co-sponsors for HR 965, there are only three Democrats from states won by Obama in 2012 who signed on to the bill: Mike McIntyre (NC), Jim Matheson (UT), and Ron Barber (AZ).

        "input": "",
        "output": "The use of social media platforms as news outlets has been on the rise in recent years, with many people turning to sites like Twitter and Facebook for their daily dose of news. However, the way people consume and share news on these platforms can influence the spread of misinformation. This article will explore how social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation.\nOne of the main ways social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news is through algorithms. Social media platforms use algorithms to determine what content is shown to users based on their interests and past behavior. This means that users are more likely to see content that aligns with their beliefs and biases, which can lead to a filter bubble effect where people only see information that confirms their existing beliefs. This can create a environment where false information can spread easily, as people are more likely to share and believe false information that aligns with their worldview.\nAnother way social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news is through sponsored content. Social media platforms allow companies and organizations to pay to promote their content to targeted audiences. This can lead to a situation where false or misleading information is disguised as legitimate news, which can further contribute to the spread of misinformation.\nFinally, social media platforms can also influence the way people consume and share news through the use of influencers. Influencers are individuals who have a large following on social media and are able to influence their followers' behavior and opinions. By partnering with influencers, companies and organizations can promote their products or messages to large audiences. However, this can also lead to the spread of false information, as influencers may not always fact-check the information they share.\nIn conclusion, social media platforms have a significant impact on the way people consume and share news.

However, it is possible to speculate based on what is known about Native American cultures and European exploration.\nIf a Native American civilization had crossed the Atlantic, they may have built settlements and cities in the Americas. Many Native American tribes lived in permanent settlements and constructed large villages and towns. They also had advanced farming techniques, which would have allowed them to support larger populations in these settlements.\nThe Native Americans' impact on the native peoples of the Americas would have been significant. They would likely have encountered and interacted with other Native American tribes, trading goods and ideas. They may also have fought with other tribes over resources or territory.\nAs for interactions with Europeans, it is possible that they could have encountered Europeans before they arrived in large numbers. If this was the case, it is possible that there could have been friendly trade relationships or even alliances formed between the two groups. However, it is also possible that the Native Americans could have viewed the Europeans as a threat and fought against them.\nOverall, the consequences of this hypothetical scenario would have been significant for both Native Americans and Europeans.

You're only making yourself an equal. You don't deserve to be treated like that, and your boyfriend shouldn't treat you equally. He should know better. If you want to know what to do about it, go to relationship advice.\nAnswer by dancinmom_78 at 12:47 PM on Dec. 3, 2010\nIt's never okay to cheat. Don't let him make you into someone you're not.\nAnswer by momlovesdogs at 12:49 PM on Dec. 3, 2010\nThat is definitely not okay! I am so sorry this happened to you. It sounds like you need to talk to your bf about why he did this and maybe you two need couples counseling. But either way, cheating is not okay. It will destroy what little trust you have left. You are better than that. Talk to him and tell him how you feel. It might help if he knows how much his actions hurt you.\nAnswer by hollyblue at 12:51 PM on Dec. 3, 2010\ndo not cheat on him it is wrong no matter what he does it does not give you the right to do it again. there is no excuse for it. it will just lead to more heart ache and pain. you need to think about your self respect too. your bf needs to man up and"

They are popular with frequent flyers who want to drown out the noise of the plane engine. There are 3 main types of noise cancelling technology used in headphones: active, passive and hybrid. The active noise cancelling (ANC) technology uses small microphones that detect the ambient noise and then generate an opposite sound wave to cancel it out. Passive noise cancellation happens when the earcups completely cover the ears so that no external noise can enter. Hybrid models use a combination of active and passive technologies to achieve the best results."

How do they not snap?\nHomicide detectives are exposed to brutal violence and intense suffering. They have to be strong to be able to cope with the trauma of their jobs.

I believe that if a cop lets himself become numb to the world around him, he is failing at his job.\nCops don't simply observe a grisly crime scene and then move on with their life.

Prior to the atomic bombings, the US had invaded Japan on September 15, 1945 at Peleliu Island in Palau. Japanese land forces continued to fight fiercely against US Marines and Army troops. Tokyo firebombing (March 9-10, 1945) and Doolittle Raid (April 18, 1942) showcased the devastating power of US air power. However, the Japanese were still fighting hard. On June 6, 1944, the US invaded France at Normandy. By July 24, 1944, US troops fought their way into Paris. From August 1944 until May 1945, the US pushed the Germans back all across Western Europe.

This is because there are 12 notes in an octave on a piano, and each note signifies a different note in the scale. The notes are played by pressing the keys on the piano.\nIs it true that the number of keys on a piano changed from 52 to 88 in 1904?\nAccording to this answer, yes.\nThis may not be the answer you're looking for, but many things you take for granted started as experiments. For example, when the first record player was invented, it played at 78 RPM, then 45 RPM. In both cases, these were tests of new technologies, and later became the standards for playback speeds.\nAs to your question, no one knows for sure. There are several theories, but no single theory explains everything. One theory is that it's because there are 12 notes in an octave. Another is that it's because there are 12 semitones between any two notes (a perfect fifth or a perfect fourth). Yet another is that it's because there are 12 chromatic tones between any two whole tones (a tritone).\nTo expand on J...'s answer, the twelve-tone equal temperament tuning system can be understood as a compromise between various conflicting desires. Since pitches are measured by their relative positions as frequencies, some equally spaced intervals are preferred over others; more precisely, ratios constructed from small integers are preferred over other ratios. The octave, for example, is the most commonly occurring interval in music (and the only interval having integer ratio); therefore, since the octave has to be split into twelve equal parts, all the other semitones"

This is especially a problem when you have a large number of employees (or customers) who all need to change their passwords.\nChanging password so frequently can be a real pain, and there is some evidence that it doesn't actually increase security very much:\nA 2015 paper from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), \"Password Security Questions and Answers\" found that using password questions and answers didn't significantly reduce account takeover fraud. That suggests that if attackers gain access to one account, they will try to use that as a stepping stone to get into others. If they find out someone's birth date, for example, that could help them figure out a target's mother's maiden name or high school.\nA 2017 paper from Carnegie Mellon University titled \"Time to Change Your Password? Not Necessarily,\" argues that changing your password too often just causes hassle without any real benefit. While users who get lazy about their passwords and leave them at \"password\" aren't helped by frequent changes, the researchers found that users who are more diligent in changing their passwords eventually will hit a cap -- they'll start using really long passwords that are hard to crack but also hard for the user to remember.\nThe researchers behind that study found that after six months, people tended to revert to using short, easy-to-guess passwords again. They were just expending the effort of coming up with a new password every three months instead of six.\n\"It was clear that most people had gotten to a point where they felt like they were doing a good job of managing their password, and then we asked them to change it every three months, and their performance declined,\" said Patrick McDaniel, a research scient"

        "input": "",
        "output": "January 23, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Why is there something rather than nothing? This question lies at the heart of the philosophy of existentialism, an influential movement in modern thought that has been embraced by some of the most notable philosophers and writers of the 20th century. The answer you will find from these thinkers varies wildly: from the idea that life’s meaning is subjective and up to each individual to choose; to the notion that all life is ultimately futile and it is better to just “make yourself happy”; to the belief that life is a gift from God, and we should live it in grateful service to our Creator.\nBut surely, one might say, if the universe did not exist, then nothing would exist, so how can anything be meaningless if everything is ultimately dependent on everything else? There must be some ultimate source of meaning, for otherwise why does the universe exist at all?\nThis is the conundrum that confronts us when we ask the question: “Why is there something rather than nothing?” That is, if the universe had a beginning (as many scientists now agree it did), then what was before the big bang? And what caused that cause? And before that cause? And so on ad infinitum. Either we have an infinite regression of causes, or something exists that transcends time and space and is eternal.\nMany philosophers and theologians have argued that this transcendent being (known as God in the Christian tradition) is the ultimate source of meaning. Without such a being, its proponents argue, life has no ultimate significance.\n“If you want to be more specific,” says C.S. Lewis, “you have got to come down to a man like myself who believes in a real, personal Being who is Himself the ultimate reality and"

How can I know if a particular book is widely used and well accepted?. \n\nI will be using this book as a reference work for my essay, so it needs to be scholarly, not pop-cultural.\n\npopular-culture\n\nComment: Please provide more details or context about what field you're talking about.  Are you interested in popular culture in general or a specific field such as history, film studies, literature, cultural studies, etc.?\n\nAnswer: This depends on your discipline. In many fields, especially the social sciences, books which are widely used and well accepted are often those with institutional or professional organization backing. For instance, in sociology, books published by either Cambridge University Press or the University of Chicago Press would be good bets, given their marketshare.  Additionally, some textbooks (such as the classic \"The American Journey\" by Hubert Locke and Ronald Smith) have been used for decades, and are still considered standard reading for undergraduate survey courses. Textbooks in the humanities are also important, but not quite as much as in the social sciences. In English literature, for instance, \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\" is a massive bestseller, and has been so for many decades.  So, to answer your question directly, find out what books are commonly used in the courses at the university level in your discipline, and see if they are bestsellers or backed by large publishers."
