For example, when learning about the forces between nucleons, think about why two balls rolling along a pool table will eventually stop, while they'll keep rolling forever on a trampoline. Or think about why a pile driver works: it's pushing down on the tip of the pile driver with much greater force than the tiny amount of force being applied by the nails going into the wood. When you think about what's really happening in terms of the strong force, it's much easier to wrap your head around."

Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

The study was published July 9 in Nature Nanotechnology. The findings could lead to more effective and less toxic chemotherapies for cancers with high levels of KRAS mutations, which include most pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\nAs they have previously done with other types of cancer, the researchers first labeled gold nanoparticles with antibodies that target specific receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. In this case, the team labeled gold nanoparticles with an antibody against GPR106, a G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed on the surfaces of KRAS-mutant cancer cells but not on normal cells.\nKRAS is a small G protein that plays an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation. Around 25% of all human cancers have mutations in one or more copies of KRAS, making it one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. The majority of KRAS mutations affect the G12/13 domain, which controls reorganization of the cell's cytoskeleton and modulation of signaling pathways. Mutations in KRAS are associated with poor outcomes for patients, even if they receive chemotherapy, according to the National Cancer Institute.\nIn the latest study, when the researchers injected mice with KRAS-mutant pancreatic tumor cells, they found that the gold nanoparticles accumulated at the tumor site due to"

So, the question is, how many glass panes are optimal to maximize the energy efficiency while keeping the cost under a certain limit? To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors:\n1. The climate zone - the amount of heat loss or gain through windows depends on the climate zone.\n2. The thickness of each pane of glass - thicker glass provides better insulation, but it also increases the cost.\n3. The U-factor of the window - the lower the U-factor, the better the window is at preventing heat loss or gain.\n4. The cost of the windows - as the number of panes increases, the cost of the windows also increases.\nTo find the optimal number of glass panes, we need to balance the energy savings with the cost of the windows. We can use a linear programming approach to solve this problem. Let's assume that we have two variables, N and C, representing the number of glass panes and the cost of the windows, respectively. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (measured in terms of the U-factor) subject to a limit on the cost of the windows. The constraints are:\n1. The maximum number of glass panes is 3.\n2. The cost of the windows cannot exceed a certain limit, say Cmax.\nThe linear programming problem can be written as follows:\nMaximize U-factor Subject to Constraints:\nN ≤ 3\nC ≤ Cmax\ns.t.

Carbon Fibers have a lot of strength and stiffness in little mass, so they’re an amazing materials for structural functions. A carbon fiber can help stretch the extent of a concrete slab or maintain a bridge column upright.\nA key characteristic of carbon fibers is their ability to withstand large amounts of pressure without ripping. They will resist breaking when subjected to forces like wind or seismic exercise. They are additionally sturdy against corrosion and rust, which makes them perfect for outside purposes.\nCarbon fibers are also used for architectural capabilities. Architects use them for roofing and facade cladding, as they may be very light-weight and inflexible. Furthermore, they could act as a heat sink, dissipating warmth from the within of a constructing to the skin.\nCarbon fibers have many benefits for the building industry, together with excessive strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to corrosion and rust, and the power to resist large amounts of pressure.
