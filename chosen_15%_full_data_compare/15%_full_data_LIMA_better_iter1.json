If you are not too tired, you may want to take a stroll down the famous Las Vegas Strip to get a feel of the city. You can also head over to the Bellagio Hotel and see the world-famous Fountain Show.\nDay 2: Theme Parks & Shows\nOn day 2, you can head to one of the many theme parks in Vegas such as the Adventuredome or the Stratosphere. The Adventuredome has rides and attractions for all age groups including indoor skiing, roller coasters, go-karts, a haunted house, and more. The Stratosphere offers thrilling rides and amazing views of the city. Another great option would be to check out a show on the strip. Some popular shows include Cirque du Soleil, Blue Man Group, and Le Reve.\nDay 3: Gambling & Shopping\nSpend your third day gambling and shopping along the strip. There are many casinos to choose from and each offer different games and experiences. Some popular stops include Caesars Palace, Wynn, and the Venetian for high-end shopping.

Innovation: When we bring different perspectives to the table, we are more likely to come up with innovative solutions to problems. This can lead to new products and services that appeal to a wider audience.\n2. Talent: Diverse teams are more likely to attract top talent from all backgrounds. This means that we can access a wider pool of talented individuals who can bring unique skills and perspectives to the table.\n3. Profitability: Companies with diverse and inclusive cultures have been shown to be more profitable than those without. This is because diverse teams are better at problem-solving, collaboration, and decision-making.\n4. Social responsibility: Tech companies have a responsibility to create a more equitable world. By promoting diversity and inclusion, we can help level the playing field for underrepresented groups and create a more just society.\nSo, my fellow tech bros, I urge you to embrace diversity and inclusion. It's not only the right thing to do, but it's also good for business. Let's work together to create a more diverse and inclusive tech industry that benefits us all."

In my case, I want to apply it to a language modeling task where the input is a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of words with the same length.\nGiven this sequence: \"the cat sat on the mat\"\nThe position embedding would be a 3-dimensional vector where each dimension represents the relative position of a token within the sequence. For example, the first dimension might represent the position of the first token relative to the rest of the sequence (e.g. how far left it is). The second dimension might represent the position of the second token relative to the first token, etc.\nNow, let's say I want to predict the next word in the sequence. I can use the current positional embedding as an initial value for the new positional embedding, then update the values based on the previous embedding and the current token.\nHowever, this seems like it would only capture local dependencies between tokens. If there are multiple ways to split the sequence into sub-sequences, then the model would choose whichever one yields the highest loss, even if that choice doesn't actually generalize well to new sequences.\nFor example, consider the sequence \"the cat sat on the mat\". We could split it into two sequences \"the cat sat\" and \"on the mat\". If we generate a new sequence by randomly selecting which of these two sub-sequences to use, then the model will always choose \"the cat sat\", even though \"on the mat\" is more likely based on the context.\nHow would one solve this problem?

The concept was first introduced by Jack Edmonds in 1954. \n\nThe basic idea behind computational irreducibility is that some problems are so complex that no matter how powerful the computer becomes, they will never be able to solve them efficiently. This means that even if we know how to solve the problem, we will never be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nFor example, factoring large integers is a computationally irreducible problem. Even if we knew the exact formula for factoring an integer, we would never be able to use this formula to factor very large numbers efficiently. This is because the number of operations required to factor a large number grows exponentially with its size. \n\nSimilarly, finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph is a computationally irreducible problem. Even if we knew the exact algorithm to find the shortest path, the amount of computation required to solve this problem for large graphs would be prohibitive.\n\nOverall, computational irreducibility highlights the limitations of computers and shows that some problems are simply beyond the capabilities of current technology."

If we're talking something like quantum computing, it could completely revolutionize how information is processed and stored, potentially leading to a massive shift in the way society operates. On the other hand, something like genetic engineering or artificial intelligence might not have such a profound impact.\nHere are some ideas for how this new technology could affect society:\n1. Automation - If the new technology allows for the automation of certain tasks or industries, it could lead to significant job losses and societal changes. For example, if self-driving cars become commonplace, many taxi drivers and truck drivers could find themselves out of work.\n2. Medical breakthroughs - New technology could lead to major advances in medical treatments and cures, potentially saving lives and improving overall health and wellbeing.\n3. Environmental impact - If the new technology has a negative impact on the environment, society could be forced to grapple with issues like pollution, climate change, and resource depletion.\n4. Social changes - The new technology could also lead to shifts in societal values and norms, particularly if it enables new forms of communication or facilitates new ways of connecting with people. For example, the rise of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have fundamentally changed the way people communicate and interact with each other.\n5. Economic impact - Finally, the new technology could have a significant impact on the global economy, either through the creation of new industries or the demise of old ones.

I’ve used snow chains before, but it was on a vehicle with rear wheel drive and it was pretty simple. This time though I’m not sure how to install them correctly on my AWD Honda CR-V. The chain installer says to put them on the rear drivers side tire first, then the front driver side tire, followed by the rear passenger side tire, and lastly the front passenger side tire. Is this correct? Or does it matter which direction they go on? Also, how do you know if they are on correctly?\nsnow honda awd cr-v tire-chaining\nThis really depends on what kind of chains you have. In Europe they use \"scissor jacks\" that fit over the tires and clamp shut underneath. Those have a specific orientation (right-side up) when installed. Others use two sets of metal teeth that interlock with each other, and those too can have a preferred orientation (but usually only on the outer edges of the tread). Yours may be screw-on chains - metal bands with protrusions that screw onto the tires lug nuts, or some version thereof. – Pᴀᴜʟsᴏɴ Oct 30 '18 at 22:25\nRear wheels should be done first.

It can be really hard to get over someone who has broken up with you – but there are ways that you can make the process easier.\nThe first thing is to try to accept that the relationship is over. This might sound simple, but it can be hard to truly accept that you’re not going to see this person again. Ask yourself if there is anything you can do to fix the situation. If you’ve done everything you can, then accept that it’s over. Acceptance is hard, but it’ll make it easier for you to move on.\nAnother way to cope is to remember why the relationship ended. You might feel like it’s your fault – but there might be other reasons too. Try to look at the situation objectively, and think about whether what they said makes sense. If they are being honest, it might help you to understand a bit more about why things didn’t work out.\nIt’s also important to talk to people you trust. Talking to your friends and family can help you to move on, because they can offer support and advice. They might have been in similar situations and be able to help you through it. Write down how you feel too, because sometimes it can be helpful to get your feelings down on paper.\nFinally, try to focus on yourself. Thinking about everything you want to do when you’re single again can help you to feel less sad. Spend time with your friends, go out and have fun, read books and watch movies that you enjoy. Don’t forget to take care of yourself physically too – getting enough sleep and eating well will help you to feel better."

We have been warned about this before. In the mid-1970s, the Club of Rome published a report called \"Limits to Growth\" which predicted doom for the planet unless we changed our ways. What happened? The population continued to rise but growth slowed while we improved technology and became more efficient. This allowed us to use water more effectively, so there was no shortage.\nA recent report by the Global Water Institute estimates that if we continue on the same trend we are on today, we will be able to meet the needs of the growing population with only a 3% loss of current freshwater resources. That doesn't sound like much until you realize that we can reduce our freshwater losses by implementing better technologies and conservation methods.\nWe are currently losing 32% of all freshwater due to inefficient use. If we were to implement better farming practices, less wasteful appliances, and more efficient irrigation systems, we could reduce that number significantly.\nIt seems that we have the ability to turn this problem around if we put our minds to it, but the problem is, humans are not very good at making sacrifices.

This article will help explain how it works. Healthcare is provided by many different organizations, including hospitals and clinics, pharmacies, insurance companies, and government agencies. These organizations work together to provide care for patients.\nThe US has a mixed public/private healthcare system. The government provides some services, while private companies provide other services. Most Americans get their health insurance through their employers. If you do not have insurance, you can buy it on your own. There are several types of insurance plans available, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks.\nHealthcare providers include doctors, nurses, dentists, therapists, lab technicians, and other professionals who provide medical care. They work together as teams to provide comprehensive care for patients. Most healthcare facilities are accredited by The Joint Commission. This means that they must meet certain standards of quality and safety.\nWhen you go to the doctor or hospital, you will likely see a team of healthcare providers. For example, a primary care physician (PCP) may refer you to a specialist if they think you need more specialized care. Specialists include cardiologists, neurologists, and orthopedists.

She finds the work very easy and so bores her. She is constantly telling me that the kids in her class are boring. I want to help her make friends and find kids who can keep up with her, but I also don't want to squash her excitement about being smart.\nKids sometimes pick up on each other's vibes and if she seems to think they're boring, then it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I suspect that some of the girls she knows are shy or socially awkward, and lacking in confidence, which will slow their social development. It might help to tell her that some kids just take longer to get to know them than others, and that being smart isn't something to hide.\n(In our culture, being smart is often viewed as a good thing.) When I was in primary school, I used to feel isolated because my best friend and I were both really into reading and would often walk home from school together and talk about books. Now I realise that most kids that age aren't interested in reading (or at least, not as much as we were). My brother had similar issues when he went through puberty, because he was quite sensitive and felt awkward around other boys his age. He tells me now that this made it impossible for him to form any close male friendships until high school.\nTo help your daughter make friends, you could join forces with her teachers to encourage the class to do things like book reports/presentations together; have an interview session where each kid gets to ask another kid a question and report back to the class on what they learned; assign the class different countries and have them research"

Rating: 8,9/10 1364 reviews\nThe Influence of Culture on Consumer Behavior\nSometimes marketers will use these subtle cues to get people to take a specific action. Research shows that women are more likely to read about health and beauty products, while men tend to be more interested in reading about automobiles. . They may even have different attitudes toward time, money, and risk. An example of this would be simply having two similar products such as a can of Coke or Pepsi, but one being marked 50 cents cheaper than the other. Social media is another platform which allows for marketers to reach target audiences that are relevant to their product or service with minimal effort. For example, if you like to eat at certain restaurants, or shop at certain stores, this means that your values align with those brands. It's a good idea to keep an eye on competitors and what they're doing. The social aspect of shopping encourages consumers to interact with salespeople and other consumers alike.

This feature is useful during training, as it allows the model to adjust its parameters according to the loss value. PyTorch, on the other hand, uses a technique called autodiff, which is slower but more general. JAX also includes a variety of computational primitives that enable efficient numerical computations, such as matrix multiplication and elementwise operations. These primitives are built on top of NumPy arrays, which makes them highly performant and flexible.\nThe main advantage of PyTorch over JAX is its simplicity. The library provides a simple way to define neural networks and their training using Python. On the other hand, JAX adds automatic differentiation to the core language, which makes training models easier without having to write complex code. Another difference is that JAX supports multiple backends, while PyTorch only supports one backend.\nJAX offers several benefits over PyTorch. First, JAX allows for automatic differentiation, which makes training models easier. Second, JAX has an extensive set of numerical primitives that make performing computations efficient. Third, JAX allows for distributed training across multiple GPUs or CPUs. Finally, JAX is designed to be used with Python, which makes it easier for users to learn and use.\nPytorch is written in Python, while JAX is written in C++, so JAX will be faster.

        "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health challenge for humanity and has had a devastating impact on public health, the economy, and daily life. While governments have been forced to introduce restrictions in an effort to control the spread of the virus, it has become clear that these measures alone are not enough.\nTherefore, there is an immediate need for reliable, accurate, and accessible screening tools that can be used at scale to identify infected individuals. One promising approach is the use of dogs' exceptional sense of smell to sniff out the virus.\nRecent studies have shown that dogs can detect the disease with high accuracy, similar to PCR tests, and this has generated significant interest in using canines to screen people for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, building and deploying such a system presents many challenges, not least the fact that dogs are unpredictable and need constant training.\nNow, researchers from ETH Zurich in Switzerland have developed a machine learning algorithm that can predict whether someone is infected with COVID-19 based on their breath sample. The algorithm tested well against trained dogs in trials and achieved a similar level of accuracy.\nThe researchers believe that their technology could be deployed on a large scale to help guide policies and strategies to combat the virus, while also providing a more comfortable testing experience for patients.\n\"Our results show that using electronic noses, which mimic the ability of dogs to detect the virus in exhaled breath, may be a viable solution for point-of-care applications,\" says first author Dr. Marco Tampucci, who worked on the study while he was a postdoctoral fellow at ETH Zurich.\n\"We envision that our system could be integrated into public places such as airports, train stations, and hospitals, where it would"

The AI system also predicts which patients are most likely to require interventions such as medication or lifestyle changes to manage their condition. This allows healthcare providers to intervene early before the condition progresses, reducing the need for expensive treatments or hospitalizations later on.\nThe AI system can also help streamline administrative tasks such as scheduling appointments and managing patient billing. By automating these processes, healthcare providers can free up time to focus on providing more personalized care to patients.\nAdditionally, AI can be used to improve the accuracy of diagnoses by analyzing medical images such as X-rays or MRIs. This can help reduce misdiagnoses and ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment for their conditions.\nOverall, the use of AI in healthcare can lead to improved outcomes for patients, increased efficiency in healthcare delivery, and reduced costs for healthcare providers."

        "output": "The director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis S. Collins , addressed this question during a recent town hall on Facebook.\nCollins noted that vaccines work by preparing the immune system to recognize and fight a pathogen. When a person is vaccinated, their immune system produces antibodies that recognize certain foreign substances — in this case, specific proteins found on the surface of a virus or bacteria. If the person is later exposed to that pathogen, their immune system is prepared to fight it off, potentially preventing the development of the disease.\nAs for herd immunity, Collins explained that it occurs when a critical mass of people in a community are protected from an infectious disease, either through vaccination or natural exposure and recovery. This acts as a buffer against the spread of disease, as unvaccinated individuals are less likely to come into contact with the disease if most of those around them are immune.\nHerd immunity can be achieved through vaccination rates of approximately 90 percent, Collins said. He added that this may vary depending on the specific disease and the population being vaccinated.\nDuring the town hall, Collins also addressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, noting that they are rigorously tested before being approved for use and have been shown to be safe and effective for the vast majority of people. He also emphasized the importance of vaccines in protecting public health, citing the example of smallpox, which was eradicated globally thanks in part to a successful vaccination campaign."

A 2019 survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania found that 78% of Americans think NASA's budget should be increased.\nThe debate over whether we have a moral obligation to explore space or focus on solving problems here on Earth highlights a centuries-old tension. On one side are those who argue that expanding human knowledge through exploration is a noble endeavor in and of itself. On the other side are those who argue that we should prioritize solving the problems here at home because the wellbeing of our planet and its people is at stake.\nExploring space offers many potential benefits. It can help increase our understanding of the universe, which could lead to new discoveries in science and technology. It can also inspire young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Additionally, commercial space travel could create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. economy.\nHowever, focusing on Earth's problems first has some solid arguments as well. For one, investing in space exploration comes at the expense of funding other areas like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Furthermore, if we have limited resources, it may not be the wisest use of funds to pursue space exploration when there are so many urgent issues facing us here on Earth.\nAt the end of the day, deciding whether we have a moral obligation to explore space or focus on solving problems here on Earth is a complex decision that requires careful deliberation."

The only jobs left would be ones that require creativity, critical thinking, or social interaction. Should we prioritize job creation or technological progress in this situation?\nPrioritizing job creation:\n- This would involve finding ways to create new jobs that require human skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, and social interaction.\n- This could involve investing in education and training programs to help people develop these skills.\n- This could also involve creating new industries or sectors that require human labor.\nPrioritizing technological progress:\n- This would involve continuing to develop and advance technologies that can replace human labor.\n- This could involve investing in research and development to create new and improved automation and robotics technologies.\n- This could also involve encouraging companies to move towards more automated production processes.\nIn my opinion, it is important to prioritize both job creation and technological progress. While it is important to find ways to create new jobs that require human skills, it is also important to continue developing and advancing technologies that can replace human labor. By doing so, we can promote economic growth and development while also ensuring that humans remain an important part of the workforce. Additionally, by investing in research and development, we can create new industries and sectors that require human labor, which can help to further stimulate economic growth and development."

If those conquests had not happened, the political, economic and social landscape of the world would be completely different today.\nWithout the Mongol conquests, there may have been no Golden Horde and their eventual split with Moscow, which led to the formation of the Russian Empire in 1462. The western part of modern-day Russia could have remained under control of the Kievan Rus’, who were vassals of the Mongols. Or perhaps, a new power could have arisen in the region, such as Lithuania, whose Grand Duchy ruled much of the same territory as the future Russian Empire.\nIn Eastern Europe, Poland, Hungary and the rest of the region could have remained independent kingdoms, potentially leading to more regional conflicts than we see today. Furthermore, a strong Mongol presence in Eastern Europe could have prevented the spread of the Black Death, which was carried by fleas on rats and entered Europe through the port of Caffa, now part of Crimea.\nIn China, the Yuan Dynasty, established by Kublai Khan, would never have existed, meaning the country would still be controlled by the Song Dynasty. This could have resulted in significant changes in the way China developed over the centuries, including its approach to science, philosophy, art and culture. In addition, Mongolia itself would likely be a very different place today, as it was heavily influenced by both Chinese and Muslim cultures during the Yuan Dynasty.\nIn the Middle East, the Mongols facilitated trade between East and West, allowing for greater cultural, economic and religious exchange. Without them, this exchange could have been hindered, potentially resulting in a less diverse and less connected region. In addition"

It is quite possible that Newton never would have reached Cambridge, where he became one of the greatest scientific minds in history.\nBut what if his biological discoveries had been just as profound as his mathematical inventions?.\nNewton made many breakthroughs in biology, far more than most people know. Many of these discoveries were documented in \"Newtons Biological Legacy\" by James Gowen.\nIsaac Newton was passionate about biology. He spent years studying the anatomy of animals, particularly insects. If he had not become interested in physics and mathematics, he might have become a famous biologist or zoologist.\nNewtons theories on germs were decades ahead of their time. He hypothesized that microorganisms caused infectious diseases, which he called \"contagia.\" He also described how parasites could be transmitted from one host to another.\nHe also formulated the theory of inheritance long before Gregor Mendel. In a letter to Robert Hooke, he described how traits are passed down from generation to generation.\nNewton thought all life on Earth came from the same source. He believed that spontaneous generation did not occur, meaning that new organisms did not come into existence without a predecessor already present. This was a radical idea at the time, and it was widely rejected by other scientists.\nNewtons research was extensive. He even conducted experiments on plants, observing that they grew faster when exposed to sunlight.\nIf Newtons biological findings had been taken more seriously, we might have learned about genetics and inheritance much earlier than we did. We might not have to wait until the 20th century for the discovery of antibiotics."

This will force other players to pay you rent, which will help you build up your wealth quickly. Another good strategy is to ignore properties that are already owned by someone else.

As an English speaker, you may have come across certain obstacles that make it difficult for you to learn the Hebrew language. Well, you are not alone. Almost everyone who has learned or is learning Hebrew struggles with some of the following points.\n1. Reading Hebrew is much harder than it seems!\nOne of the reasons why many people find reading Hebrew so hard is because they can’t perceive the connection between the text they see and the sound they hear. This lack of connection comes from the fact that the Hebrew alphabet contains only consonants, and each consonant has more than one possible pronunciation. Additionally, due to the grammar rules in the language, there are words that are written differently but pronounced the same way. Sometimes it is even difficult to guess which word is being referred to by reading the text, let alone reading it accurately.\n2. Vowels are not written!\nHebrew is read without vowels! As mentioned above, this makes it hard to connect the text and its sound. This also means that native speakers don’t usually know how to pronounce words that they haven’t heard before. In addition, since vowels are not written, it is very easy to misspell words when writing them.\n3. Grammar is complicated!\nHebrew grammar is a lot more complicated than that of most other languages. It has three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), verb conjugations, and complicated sentence structure. Just like in English, nouns and verbs have multiple forms, especially in the past tense.\n4. Some letters have several sounds!\nIn English, each letter represents only one sound. In Hebrew, however, the same letter can represent different sounds depending on where it appears"

The Confederate States of America would have become a separate country with its own government, currency, and laws. This new nation would have been based on slavery and inherited racism, with black people being denied basic human rights.\nThe North, however, would have remained intact and continued to grow and develop. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing at the time, and the North had the advantage of being able to use its industrial power to conquer the South.\nIn addition, the North had a strong moral conviction against slavery. If the South had won, slavery would have been institutionalized throughout the country, and millions of black people would have remained enslaved for another century or more.\nSo while the South may have won some battles during the Civil War, in the end, the North's strength, resources, and moral standing would have made victory impossible for the South."

The article discusses how this problem is central to the quest to create an artificial intelligence that can complete any computational problem.\n\nToday, we have computers that are able to solve hard problems. For example, they can determine whether or not there exists a shortest path between two cities in a transportation network after some time. But currently, we don’t have computers that can solve very hard problems very quickly. This issue is known as the P vs NP problem. It is an open question in computer science if every problem in the class of NP (nondeterministic polynomial) problems has a solution in the class of polynomial time problems.\n\nRead more at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/science/computer-science-p-vs-np-problem.html"

But again, please keep in mind that this could have side effects and should only be done with caution. It's always best to consult with a veterinarian before giving any medication to a pet.\nAnother option could be to give the dog some valerian root, which is a natural supplement that can help with anxiety and insomnia. You could add it to the dog's food or give it as a treat. However, like with Benadryl, this could also have side effects and should be done under the guidance of a vet.\nUltimately, it's important to consider the ethics of this situation and think about how our actions could affect the dog and its owner.

Welcome to another episode of my channel where we explore fascinating concepts in machine learning. Today, we're going to talk about language models. Have you ever wondered how chatbots and virtual assistants can understand what we're saying? Well, it's all thanks to language models!\nLanguage models are algorithms that are trained to predict the likelihood of a specific word or phrase based on the context of the text. They use statistical analysis and natural language processing to analyze large amounts of data and learn patterns in language.\nThere are different types of language models, but one of the most common is the neural network language model. Neural networks are computer systems modeled after the human brain, and they can be used to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately.\nThe GPT-3 language model is a great example of a neural network language model. It's able to generate human-like text and has been used to create everything from stories to code. In fact, OpenAI, the company that developed GPT-3, says that the model has a 90% accuracy rate on average.\nThat's pretty impressive, but it also raises some concerns about the ethical use of language models. For example, language models can be used to generate fake news or hate speech. It's important that we continue to develop responsible AI technologies that prioritize safety and privacy.\nIn any case, language models are an incredibly powerful tool that are changing the way we interact with technology. By understanding how they work, we can unlock new possibilities for communication and innovation."

It’s often called the “reward” chemical because it plays a role in motivation, pleasure and addiction.\nThe answer is no. There are several reasons why we can’t test for dopamine levels:\n1. Dopamine is not stored in the bloodstream, so we can’t directly measure it. Instead, we have to measure the amount of dopamine receptors which are the targets of dopamine. We also need to distinguish between dopamine 1 and 2 receptors since they are involved in different types of behavior.\n2. Most laboratories do not have the capacity to measure this accurately (as far as I know, only one lab does: http://www.genemedlab.com/dopamine-tests).\n3. Even if we could measure it, we don’t have any clinically useful treatments that increase or decrease the baseline level of dopamine. This is because drugs like Ritalin and Adderall (which are commonly used to treat ADHD) work by blocking dopamine reuptake, rather than increasing dopamine levels. It’s possible that there may be other drugs that increase dopamine levels, but I am not aware of any."

What makes this number so special?\nThe answer has to do with the geometry of circles. Let’s start with a simple example: a pizza. Cut it in half, then each of those halves in half again, and so on. You will find that the slices get smaller and smaller as you keep cutting. This is because the circumference of a circle is getting shorter and shorter as you cut into it. If you kept cutting, you would eventually end up with nothing but a point!\nNow let’s consider the decimal expansion of Pi. The first few digits are 3.14159… . If we were to continue this pattern, we could write down more and more digits forever. In fact, there are computers that have calculated Pi to over one trillion digits past its decimal point!

        "input": "",
        "output": "Is it because they don't marry first cousins?\nNo. It's because of the genetic bottleneck effect. The small founding population undergoes a lot of genetic drift, which leads to a situation where any deleterious recessive alleles are rapidly eliminated by genetic drift.\nGenetic drift is a random fluctuation in the frequency of alleles in a small population. In a large population, there is more genetic diversity to counteract the effects of genetic drift and prevent the elimination of bad alleles.\nThis is why rural areas have higher rates of genetic disease than urban areas - far fewer people means more genetic drift.\nIn the same way, if you looked at two populations with the same overall genetic diversity (i.e. same number of different alleles), a larger population would have a lower rate of genetic diseases simply because their genetic drift was diluted by being spread over a larger population.\nThe same thing can happen over time in small populations. As a population gets smaller and smaller, eventually the genetic drift will eliminate all deleterious recessive alleles except for those that happen to be protective against something. This means that when two carriers of deleterious recessive alleles do mate, there is a chance that their offspring won't have the disease, and if they do have the disease, it won't be as severe as usual. So even though their children will carry the alleles, they won't necessarily suffer from the disease. If they mate with other carriers, this continues until the original deleterious alleles become benign.\nThere is still some risk of genetic problems, especially if the population gets much smaller than about 100 individuals. But sometimes small populations do survive, even without"

For example, California has a huge teacher shortage right now, and elementary schools are being forced to cut class size even further than they already are.\nThere's a surplus of people who want to teach introductory college-level classes such as \"General Psychology\" or \"Intro to American Government,\" because these are the sorts of courses that students will take to fulfill distribution requirements and thus don't require much specialized knowledge on the part of the instructor.

Of course not. If someone is trying to kill themselves and we stop them, we saved their life.\nWe all have free will. If someone wants to kill themselves that badly, and we can't talk them out of it, well, there's not much more we can do for them. But if we can keep them from doing it, we're saving a life.\nThe problem is that people are trained to think about suicide as an irrational act. Suicide is usually caused by depression, which is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. While some people who commit suicide seem like they are exhibiting perfectly rational behavior (and some do), it's only because they've been chemically altered. There is no rationality involved. Certainly no one commits suicide thinking \"gee, I'd like to die today.\"\nTherefore, attempting to stop suicides is a good thing.\nSuicide is a serious issue. Many people could benefit from treatment. Most people who commit suicide have thought about it for months or years before acting on it. They may even come up with a plan.

Obviously this would yield different results in cooking and texture. What about other cultures like India (cutting along the bone), China (cutting along the grain of the meat), Italy,...etc?\nThe idea of cutting across the grain is to make sure the meat fibers are as perpendicular as possible to the surface you're cutting on so they can be cut easily and evenly. So if you're cutting steak against the grain, the meat fibers are more at a 90 degree angle to the knife blade instead of parallel or perpendicular. The same goes for any meat: pork, lamb, chicken, etc. Cutting along the bone makes sense only if you're making stock or broth from it, otherwise you lose most of the meat. – Jolenealaska♦ Dec 20 '16 at 15:13\n@Jolenealaska That's a great point.

High-end restaurants have been doing this for a while. It’s called “mise en place,” and it’s a French term referring to the practice of having all ingredients arranged and ready to go before cooking begins. By prepping everything ahead of time, chefs can ensure that each dish comes out perfectly every single time. This process also allows them to plate food artistically—artfully arranging each dish with precise precision.\nIs there a reason fancy restaurants serve small portions?\nThe short answer is yes. While it’s far from the only factor that goes into determining the price you pay for a meal at a restaurant, portion size plays a role in determining what you’ll spend when you sit down to eat. Generally speaking, the more luxurious the restaurant, the smaller the portions tend to be. … Fine dining restaurants pride themselves on creativity and artistry, so they often choose to highlight a few well-executed dishes rather than pile on as much food as possible.

Let me explain why this is important.\nThe moment HR asks for money, they establish a connection between the employer and employees beyond just a business transaction. When HR asks for money, they are coming across as part of the team. This sets a precedent which can be used later on during salary negotiations etc. If HR cannot be impartial during salary negotiations, it will create distrust.\nAs an AI assistant, I am programmed to remain impartial and follow strict ethical guidelines.

They find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the generosity of welfare benefits at the state level is associated with a decrease in births to unmarried women of 4.5 percent.\nThe study also finds that generous cash assistance and Medicaid benefits have a larger impact on reducing out-of-wedlock childbearing than do food stamps, housing subsidies, and other types of benefits. This makes sense considering that a large share of poor single mothers rely on cash assistance and Medicaid for their basic needs.\nOverall, the research provides more evidence against conservative claims that social welfare programs encourage out-of-wedlock childbearing.

        "output": "You are posing an interesting question. I am not a historian, but based on what I know of history and archeology, I can make some comments.\nFirst, it depends on how one defines “evidence.” There are many clues that humans have existed for hundreds of thousands of years, including fossil evidence and artifacts. But it is difficult to date these things exactly and figure out who made them. For example, some scientists believe that the famous “Olduvai gorge” tools in Tanzania were made by human-like creatures 2 million years ago, but other scientists disagree (see this article from the New York Times). There is also some evidence that humans were living in North America 130,000 years ago, but this has been debated (e.g., see this article from Science Daily).\nSecond, it depends on how long one thinks “civilization” has existed. While humans have existed for hundreds of thousands of years, civilization as we know it only goes back about 10,000 years, when humans started to domesticate plants and animals and build large settlements. Prior to this, people lived in small nomadic bands, usually hunting and gathering. There is little evidence left of this lifestyle, because people didn’t usually stay in one place very long, and built no permanent structures.\nThird, it depends on what one means by “collapse.” If you mean a cataclysmic event like a nuclear war or meteor strike, then there would be no evidence at all. But if you mean a slow decline, over time, of modern technological society, there could be some remnants around for a while. Probably the most likely scenario would be that, say, 500 years from now, people might find our highways and housing developments, but not much more."

In order to summarize the state of the question in a sentence or two, I wrote in my dissertation’s abstract: “It is difficult to make definitive statements about the degree of cultural continuity between modern and ancient Greeks, since the available evidence is so sparse and complex.” This is still true today. But what follows are some more detailed answers to your questions.\nFirst, some general points. A lot has changed culturally in the last two and a half millennia. For example, we don’t see people sacrificing animals to gods any more (although there are still human sacrifices reported from time to time in remote parts of the world), nor do people dress up in fancy clothing and put on elaborate masks to perform rituals honoring the dead (with the possible exception of Halloween in contemporary America). There have also been enormous changes in technology: the ancient Greeks mainly used wind power for transport, while we use internal combustion engines. And the way people think about things has changed dramatically. Modern views of democracy and slavery, for instance, are nothing like those of the ancient Greeks.\nWithin Classical Greece itself, periods of great cultural change occurred at the beginning and end of the era.

Trust: It is important to trust your partner, especially when you are in a long distance relationship. This will give you both the freedom to pursue other interests while knowing that your partner has your back.\n4. Patience: Long distance relationships require patience. You have to be patient with your partner and with yourself. It is difficult to wait for your next phone call or visit. But sometimes you just have to wait.\n5. Common interests: Having similar interests is a great way to bond with a person. It's also helpful in long distance relationships because it gives you something to talk about.\n6. Respect: Respecting your partner's privacy is necessary for any relationship, but it is especially vital in long distance relationships. If your partner needs space, give them space. Don't snoop through their stuff or demand they tell you where they are every second. Give them space to breathe and come back to you refreshed, eager to spend time with you.\n7.

Some studies suggest that having or not having children may have an influence on one's risk for depression and other mental illnesses. However, many more factors must be considered to determine whether or not childlessness causes depression and other mental illnesses."

        "output": "The best way to answer is by discussing a weakness that you are working on improving, and that does not fundamentally prevent you from being able to perform your job. For example: \"I’m a perfectionist and can get caught up in the small details of projects. I’m currently working on learning how to delegate tasks so I can focus on the bigger picture.\""

        "output": "No doubt, when the iPhone X was first announced, many people thought that it would be a failure. But it has gone on to become one of Apple's most successful phones ever. The same could be said for the iPad Pro. When it was first released, many people said that it was too expensive and that no one would buy it. And yet, it has become one of Apple's most successful products ever.\nSo why do I say that these products will ultimately fail? Because they are both still very new and there is always the risk that people will decide not to upgrade to them. With the iPhone X, we are now two years into its life cycle and it is still selling very well. But in another year or two, people may decide that they don't want to buy an iPhone that is so different from what came before. With the iPad Pro, it is even more risky because it is a completely new product category for Apple. No one knows yet if people will really want a tablet that is this big and this powerful.\nOnly time will tell if these products are ultimately successful or not."

        "output": "So sorry to hear about your loss. It’s never easy having a pet pass away. Regarding the retrieval of the body and cremation, I would contact the vet that performed the euthanasia. They should be able to tell you what steps to take to properly retrieve the body and they may be able to help with the cremation as well.\nI’m so very sorry for your loss. When we lost our dog last year, we had her cremated and her ashes returned to us in an urn. Our vet gave us some paperwork to fill out to make sure we were getting the ashes of our dog. I would talk to your vet and see if they can help guide you through this process as well."

        "input": "",
        "output": "I'm a big fan of using time blocking. Here are a few more methods:\n1) Set a timer for 25 minutes, work on a task and then take a 5 minute break. This is called the Pomodoro Technique and it works really well for getting through large tasks when you get started. You can learn more about it here.\n2) Use the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize your tasks. Put tasks into four quadrants based on how important they are and how soon they need to be done. Then, work from left to right, doing the most important things first.\n3) Make a list of everything you need to do for the day/week. Then, group similar tasks together and do them in batches. For example, all the errands you need to run or all the emails you need to write. This will help you avoid context switching which can be very productive draining."
