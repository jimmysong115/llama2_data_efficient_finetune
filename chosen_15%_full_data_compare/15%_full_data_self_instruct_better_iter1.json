I'm not sure I can bring myself to care about any of these characters.\nThe best thing about it is Ismael Cruz Córdova as Arondir. His performance has been excellent.

        "input": "Dead Poets Society",
        "output": " is a movie that showcases the power of creativity and individuality. The cinematography in the film captures the beauty and complexity of these themes by using a combination of lighting, camera angles, and color schemes.\nThe film's use of lighting is particularly noteworthy. Many scenes are lit with warm, earthy tones, creating a cozy atmosphere that contrasts with the more somber moments. For example, the classroom scenes are often lit with a yellowish glow, while outdoor scenes tend to be brighter and more colorful. This contrast emphasizes the importance of escaping the confines of the classroom and exploring the world outside.\nThe camera angles also play an important role in conveying the film's themes. Shots are often taken from above, looking down on the characters, which gives the film a sense of grandeur and authority. This technique is used most effectively in the final scene, where the students stand on their desks to recite their poem. The shot is from below, looking up at the students, giving the scene a sense of empowerment and hope.\nOverall, the cinematography in Dead Poets Society is a masterful blend of lighting, camera angles, and color schemes that enhances the film's themes of creativity and individuality."

For this reason, we recommend creating customized questionnaires for your guests to fill out at the end of their stay. These questionnaires will help you collect useful information about their experience that can be used to improve future guest experiences and respond to negative reviews.\nThe most useful information you can get from your guests is why they chose your hotel (location, price or brand affiliation) and how likely they are to return or recommend your hotel to friends and family. Here are some more questions you might want to ask your guests:\n1. How did you hear about us?\n2. What was your overall experience with our hotel?\n3. Was our location convenient for your needs?\n4. Were our check-in/check-out times convenient for your schedule?\n5. Did you find our staff friendly and helpful?\n6. Were our room types suitable for your needs?\n7.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
        "output": " In Indian art, the mathematics of symmetry has been used since antiquity in the forms of the temple and its sculptural forms.\nThree-dimensional art draws on geometry for its composition. Mathematics is central to computer graphics and animation, where it may be described as \"the study of shape change\". Geometry underlies the abstraction of mathematical modelling languages such as B-Spline. The use of dynamic symmetries in computer generated art has been explored by Diana Thompson. Mathematics has also inspired some experimental musical instruments, such as the Symphicon."

Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.",
        "output": " Proponents argue that the current international trading system is unjust and promotes the exploitation of workers in poorer countries by corporations in richer countries.\nThe fair trade movement has its roots in the development of co-operative movements among European farmers in the late 19th century, who sought better prices for their crops and protested against the high commission paid to middlemen. It took a major step forward during the 1960s and 1970s as organizations such as Oxfam, Traidcraft and the British Fair Trade Association began marketing handicrafts made in developing nations to consumers in Europe and North America. Since then, fair trade has grown from a niche market to an international social movement with annual revenue of $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion) in 2013.\nThrough a number of instruments, fair trade certification guarantees that producers receive a minimum price for their commodities and that they are paid a premium on top of that price. The premium can be used to invest in infrastructure, education, health care and other community projects. The fair trade movement also promotes environmentally sustainable practices and transparency in supply chains."

Drill a hole in the top of the beer can big enough for the tea light wick to poke through. Make sure the hole is at the very bottom of the can where it will be submerged in water.\n2.

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",

The findings were reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n“We found that just a dim nighttime light, which most people would consider very low level, is enough to have consequences on metabolism,” she said. “This is an important observation.”\nZee and her team cautioned in the report that their results do not prove that light at night causes health problems; more studies are needed to establish a link.\nBut the findings are consistent with past research about artificial light interfering with sleep quality, Zee said. She noted that some studies have found increased health risks associated with shift work, in which people routinely work at night or in the early morning.\nThe artificial light from TVs, computers, smart phones, LED lights, streetlights and other sources has become part of modern life. But it’s only been in the past few decades that electricity-powered lamps and windows have replaced traditional light sources like candles, campfires, kerosene lamps and fireplaces.\nThe study participants were 16 young adults aged 18 to 29 who spent two nights in a lab sleeping with no covers over their eyes. In one session, they slept with the lights off. In the other, they slept under a dim red lamp. Blood sugar and heart rate were measured during the day and night while the participants also wore monitors to record sleep patterns.\nThe researchers found that during the night with the dim light, the participants had higher blood sugar levels and slightly lower melatonin levels – a hormone that regulates sleep and waking hours – than when the lights were off.\nA small increase in heart rate during the night doesn’t necessarily mean a person will develop heart"
