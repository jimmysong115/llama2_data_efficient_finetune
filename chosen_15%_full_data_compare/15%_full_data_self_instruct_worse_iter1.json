Maybe they'll thank you for it? Maybe they'll be annoyed? Who knows. You're not really solving for their problems right now.\nYou can try to adapt your solution to fit their view of the problem, even if it means taking a completely different route. This takes much more effort on your part, but potentially offers so many benefits.\nFirst off, you're showing that you're flexible and can adapt to changing requirements. It also gives you an opportunity to practice active listening skills and learn from the person interviewing you. Finally, you might realize that their approach is actually superior to yours. Who knows what gems you could miss by tunneling so deeply down your own solution.\nThe second option, while harder in the moment, will pay dividends later. When you get an offer at a company, you'll be able to demonstrate that you can effectively collaborate with others. You can draw on this experience when joining a new team down the line. You'll also come into the role knowing how to approach the task you need to accomplish, even if it's a little different than what you originally imagined."

One of the most interesting aspects of German is its verb conjugation.\nSo how do you end a German verb? There are actually a few different ways to do it, depending on the tense and person. In the present tense, the most common way to end a verb is with an -e or -en ending. For example, the present tense of the verb “to speak” is sprechen, while the present tense of the verb “to go” is gehen. In the past tense, the most common way to end a verb is with an -t ending. For example, the past tense of the verb “to speak” is sprach, while the past tense of the verb “to go” is ging.\nThere are also a few other ways to end a German verb, but these are the most common ones.

Here's how:\nLet's start by plugging in k = 1. Then, k^2 + 2k + 1 = (1+1)^2 + 2(1)+1 = 2 + 3 = 5 ≥ 0. This means that whenever k = 1, the inequality holds true.\nNow let's assume that for some integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0. Then, (k+1)^2 + 2(k+1) + 1 = (k+1+1)^2 + 2(k+1)+1 ≥ (k+1)^2 + 2(k+1) + 1. Since the left side is just the expression with k replaced by k+1, we know that whenever k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0, so does (k+1)^2 + 2(k+1) + 1. In other words, if k^2 + 2k + 1 is non-negative, then so is (k+1)^2 + 2(k+1) + 1.\nBut what about when k^2 + 2k + 1 is not non-negative? Can we still make (k+1)^2 + 2(k+1) + 1 non-negative? The answer is yes! We can replace k with k+1 to get a new expression that is guaranteed to be non-negative. This means that whenever k^2 + 2k + 1 is non-negative, so is (k+1)^2"

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains.
