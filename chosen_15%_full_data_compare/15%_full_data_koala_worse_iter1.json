The last silent film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture was Wings (1927). The Academy began presenting specially designated \"Best Original Song\" and \"Best Adapted Screenplay\" Oscars in 1934; both were open to songs and stories from any year. In 1935, the Academy began giving out a separate Oscar for \"Best Story\".\nBeginning in the early 1930s, most major studios entered into long-term distribution agreements with television networks, permitting broadcasts of previously released films in return for a share of advertising revenue. In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Universal Pictures v. Hollywood Film Laboratory that these television syndication rights were intellectual property, transferable for money. Previously, they had been considered a mere right to publicly perform the film, thereby preventing their sale or encumbrance.\n^ \"The top box office hits of 1936\". AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies.

In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness.

Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so.

        "output": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?\nCash is an asset, and therefore the bank has to mark it to market, which in this case means the market value of the cash (which could be zero). If the bank is undercapitalized, then they have to sell the cash at market price and take the loss (or reduce their regulatory requirements). If the bank takes the loss, then they technically don't have the cash anymore. So from a regulatory point of view, cash cannot serve as a buffer because you can't control the market value of your assets directly.\nI think the answer by @curious_cat_170 would be more suitable if the question were \"Why can't banks hold cash instead of other assets as capital?\""

Another reason is that women often face discrimination and harassment in the industry. This can make it difficult for women to succeed and can lead to them leaving the industry altogether."

It is based on a set of beliefs or ideas that are strongly held and not open to contradiction or dissent. This type of thinking is often used to justify actions or decisions that are not logically sound or based on evidence. Inconsistency, on the other hand, is the opposite of consistency. It refers to a lack of uniformity or agreement in thoughts, opinions, or statements. It can be seen as a weakness in thinking, as it allows for contradictions and contradictions that can lead to poor decision-making and a lack of clarity. However, inconsistency can also be seen as a strength in some cases, as it allows for flexibility and adaptability in thinking, which can lead to creativity and innovation. The relationship between inconsistency and ideological thinking is that inconsistency can challenge or disrupt ideological thinking, leading to a more nuanced and flexible approach to problem-solving and decision-making. On the other hand, inconsistency can also be used as a tool to maintain ideological thinking by allowing for small deviations from the established beliefs or ideas, without fully challenging them."

The study surveyed over 1,000 people between the ages of 18 and 25 about their use of social media and mental health. The results showed that those who spend more than two hours per day on social media are at a higher risk for developing depression and anxiety disorders.\nIn addition to this, another study published in the Journal of Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking in 2014 found that there is a relationship between social media use and feelings of loneliness. This study surveyed over 193 participants about their use of social media and their levels of loneliness. The results showed that those who used social media more frequently reported feeling lonelier than those who used it less frequently.\nWhile social media has its benefits, such as facilitating communication and providing a platform for self-expression, it can also have negative effects on mental health if not used in moderation. It is important for individuals to be aware of these potential risks and to take steps to mitigate them. This may include setting limits on social media use or seeking out healthier online activities."

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

First, the design of the program needs to be tailored to the audience. For example, if the learners are not native speakers of English, it may be important to devote more time to listening and speaking skills versus reading and writing. Second, cultural differences can impact how quickly learners adapt to new ideas so it may be necessary to provide additional practice opportunities and scaffolding to help them learn. Third, different cultures have different educational systems and learning styles which can impact how well they adapt to the learning program. Lastly, technology can play a big role in performance. If the technology used to facilitate the learning program is too complex or difficult to use, learners may struggle to engage with the content."

When you buy the share of any company, the money goes from your pocket to the market by selling the share. The price of the share depends on the demand and supply in the market. If there is greater demand for that share, its price will go up and vice versa. Now, if the company wants to raise money through the capital market (stock exchange), it has to issue fresh equity shares to the public through an IPO(Initial Public Offering). In this method, some portion of the shares are allotted to the general public through lottery system. These newly issued shares get listed in the stock exchange. So now you hold the share of the company whose price may go up or down depending on the demand and supply. It is the same as buying any other product in the market.\nNow suppose, the company needs more money for expansion and growth. In this case, the company can choose one of the following two options.\n1) Borrow money from the banks and financial institutions by giving them loans.\n2) Raise money through the capital market by issuing fresh equity shares.\nIf the company chooses option 1, then it has to pay back the loan with interest from its own profits. This will result in higher cost of production which will ultimately increase the price of the product and reduce the profitability of the company. This may even lead to bankruptcy of the company.\nBut if the company chooses option 2, then it can avoid this burden. First it will issue the shares to the public through IPO. Now, the person who has bought those shares, will earn dividends from the profits of the company. Along with this, you can also sell those shares in the open market"

In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

Any good survey tool should have this feature so that you can conduct as many surveys as you need without worrying about any limits.\nThe last thing worth looking at is the number of question types. A good survey tool should have a variety of question types that allow you to create different types of surveys easily.

However, from the job description it appears that the following concepts from the book may be useful to this team of Social Workers:\n\nCascading Goals\nA goal cascades down through the ranks of a community problem solvers. First responders save lives. Next-level leaders ensure that victims get the care they need. But too often the third level of leadership is missing—the people who must identify and solve the root problems that make those disasters likely in the first place. I’ve seen this pattern again and again. Take Flint, Michigan. At least four state agencies had responsibility for dealing with the city’s financial emergency, but no single leader was held accountable to the public for tackling the long-term structural issues that led to the water crisis.  The same is true for the problems that lead to routine gun violence in our cities. The police officers on the streets are responsible for taking action when guns enter their neighborhoods, but the mayors and city councils bear ultimate responsibility for public-safety failures in their communities.\nHere’s why this matters: Problem solving is hard. It takes time, it takes resources, it takes determination. When all you’re judged on is the speed and efficacy of your immediate response, it’s tempting to skimp on the upstream work. That’s a recipe for disaster, because someone else will always have to shoulder the burden of prevention, and your lack of investment becomes someone else’s calamity.\nThe “Upstream Doctrine” calls for changing this dynamic. It demands that every problem solver be accountable for both response and prevention. This means creating a structure where everyone can be measured by what she has done to prevent (or make worse) a problem as well as how she has resolved it when"

The color of the light depends on the temperature of the metal. When the temperature is low, the metal will typically emit light in a small number of colors, called the \"continuum\". As the temperature increases, more and more spectral lines are produced until a series of lines called the \"break\" appear. Above this temperature, another series of lines called the \"discharge\" appear. By studying the positions of these spectral lines, it is possible to determine the temperature at which the light was emitted."

On Tuesday, the Justice Department informed him that he must register as a foreign agent or face legal action. The news comes just weeks after another associate of Trump’s — former campaign manager Paul Manafort — was convicted of eight charges related to his work as a foreign agent.\nThe federal government has reportedly been investigating Giuliani since 2016 for his work in Ukraine on behalf of opposition leader Viktor Yanukovych. This includes work on a $50,000-a-month contract with the Ukrainian gas company Gas Alliance Ukraine Ltd., which is owned by former Soviet spy chief Vladimir Ashurkov, NBC News reports.\nGiuliani’s situation is especially problematic because he has been a vociferous critic of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election. He has also openly pushed back against the Russia probe while defending Trump, who has faced numerous allegations of colluding with Russia. In April, Giuliani told CNN he was “disgusted” by the idea that Americans would believe the Kremlin tried to undermine our democracy.\n“Russians are not our problem. It’s the Clinton people that should be in jail,” he said.\nA similar sentiment permeates many of the president’s allies, who have spent the last year and a half fixated on probing Hillary Clinton instead of working to improve relations with Russia.
