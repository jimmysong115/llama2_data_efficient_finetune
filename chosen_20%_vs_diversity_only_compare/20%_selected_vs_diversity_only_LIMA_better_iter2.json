You want to do everything you can to avoid catching a cold, but what should you do when you do get one?\nThere is no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics won't help because they only treat infections caused by bacteria, not viruses like the common cold. In fact, antibiotics will do more harm than good if taken when a virus is causing symptoms because they kill healthy bacteria in your body along with the disease-causing bacteria.\nThe best thing to do when you get a cold is to take care of yourself and let the illness run its course. While you can't completely stop a cold, there are over-the-counter medications that can relieve some of your symptoms so you feel better while your body fights off the virus.\nThese medicines may make you feel better, but they won't cure your cold. It's important to understand that while you may be able to reduce your symptoms with these medications, it can take up to two weeks for your body to fight off the virus and for your symptoms to completely go away.\nDecongestants help relieve congestion in your nose. They come in pill form or as a nasal spray. Decongestant pills work on the blood vessels in your nose which helps decrease swelling and makes it easier to breathe through your nose. Nasal sprays work quickly and are a good choice if your congestion is severe. Just be careful not to use them for more than three days or you could end up with rebound congestion where the blood vessels in your nose become even more swollen when you stop using the spray.\n"

He also suggests that we need to rethink our approach to work and redesign jobs so that they are more meaningful and fulfilling for people.\nOn the other hand, some argue that technological progress is essential to improving our standard of living and that automation can lead to increased productivity and job creation. They point out that automation has freed people from mundane and dangerous tasks, allowing them to pursue more creative and fulfilling work. However, others argue that automation has also led to job losses and that we need to ensure that the benefits of technological progress are shared more fairly.\nUltimately, prioritizing either job creation or technological progress depends on your values and beliefs about the role of technology in society.

The Native Americans would have been the first to discover the vast resources and natural beauty of the Americas, and they could have used this to their advantage. They could have established trading routes with other civilizations, built strong economic systems, and developed advanced technologies.\nHowever, there are also potential downsides to this scenario. The Native Americans may not have had the same level of knowledge or technology as the Europeans, and they may have struggled to survive in a new and unfamiliar environment. Additionally, they may have faced opposition from other civilizations who wanted to control the resources of the New World.\nOverall, it is impossible to know what would have happened if a Native American civilization was the first to cross the Atlantic, but it is an interesting hypothetical scenario to consider."

It is one of the least developed countries in the world; however, it has been recording strong economic growth since it embraced free-market reforms in the late 20th century, and its GDP per capita has been rising steadily ever since.[1]\nMongolia has very few natural resources, a harsh climate, and extremely sparsely populated. It became part of the Soviet Union in 1945 and, following the disintegration of that political entity, gained independence in 1991. In the 1990s and into the early 2000s, Mongolia had to deal with major financial troubles because of its heavy debt burden and an economic crisis brought on by a sharp decline in prices for its primary export, copper. Since then, it has experienced economic growth thanks to the development of its mining industry, which accounts for about a third of its gross domestic product (GDP).[2]\nWhat would the world be like if Mongolia had never existed? The answer to this question depends on what you mean by \"the world.\" If you are asking about the geopolitical state of the world, then Mongolia's nonexistence would have little effect. However, if you are asking about the cultural heritage of the world, then Mongolia's nonexistence would have far-reaching impacts.\nThe Mongol Empire was founded by Genghis Khan in 1206.

To counteract this, we started actively recruiting people with a background in physics, math or computer science, even if they didn't have as much experience as software engineers.\nNow, unless you have good reasons to believe that the best candidates are female (and not male), then you should assume that all candidates are equally skilled. That means that there's no reason to prefer one gender over the other.\nUnfortunately, since you are the only woman in the team, you do stick out. You need to accept that, and learn to deal with it. This might mean asking your fellow engineers to introduce you to new people and help you get to know everyone better.\nIt also means that you shouldn't expect your coworkers to understand completely what it's like to be a woman in a team full of men. Of course, they should try to be nice and helpful, but they probably won't be able to relate to how you feel on a day-to-day basis.\nIf you can, try to find some female colleagues who can help you through this difficult time.

The rover would also need to survive being exposed to the harsh environment of near-Earth space. Once at the asteroid, power would need to be generated to run the rover’s systems and scientific instruments. Finally, you would need to figure out a way to maintain communication with Earth from so far away. However, this is all very doable given enough time and money."

One of his other students even told me directly during an application talk that he would not recommend me to his advisor because I am Chinese. I tried to apply to another professor who has published joint works with my advisor but he also rejected me explicitly saying that he cannot trust Chinese students due to their reputation of \"plagiarism and fraud\".\nAnother professor (who is not Chinese himself) rejected me after the phone interview saying that he does not believe that I will finish my thesis by the deadline since I am Chinese. The other professors didn't bother to reply to my emails, probably also because I'm Chinese.\nThis is infuriating and demoralizing. How should I proceed?

Choice is the most common, followed by Select, then Standard.\nI'm not sure about other cultures, but in the U.S., the grading system for beef is based on the amount and distribution of marbling (aka \"fat\") in the meat. The higher the grade, the more marbling. This is because marbling is considered to be good for flavor and tenderness. However, more marbling also makes the meat more expensive. USDA Prime is the highest grade, with the most marbling, which is why it's also the most expensive."

It's still controversial, though, since there are many other organs that can host large numbers of bacteria, but no one seriously argues they're \"vestigial\".\nEvolution isn't perfect - it doesn't create organisms which are optimized at every level. There are lots of \"junk\" DNA and old structures which seem to have lost their original function.
