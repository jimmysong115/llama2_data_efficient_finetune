He followed them through the market and into the shop where they were to purchase the flowers.\nAs soon as they stepped inside, however, he noticed something was amiss. The air felt heavy, almost like it was pushing down on him. Hands reached out from everywhere, grabbing at him and tugging him this way and that. He struggled against them, but each time he managed to free himself, someone else would grab his arm or shoulder. He quickly realized he couldn't fight them off, and he gave up trying. There was nothing he could do but wait until it was over.\n\"What's going on?\" he demanded, turning to the Warrior of Light. \"Why is everyone acting so oddly?\"\n\"That's not everyone,\" the Warrior of Light replied, watching as one of the vendors tried to take a hold of Hildibrand. \"Just the shadows.

It is used for agriculture, industry, and domestic purposes. However, if not managed properly, water can become a source of danger and destruction. Water Safety Engineering is a discipline that focuses on reducing the risk of floods, droughts, and other water-related hazards. In this paper, we will present a water safety engineering project that addresses the problem of flooding in urban areas.\nProblem: Flooding in Urban Areas\nUrban areas are prone to flooding due to their impermeable surfaces and lack of natural drainage systems. When it rains, the water cannot seep into the ground but instead runs off into the streets, causing flooding. This can lead to damage to property and infrastructure, as well as loss of life.\nSolution: Retention Basin\nThe solution to the problem of flooding in urban areas is to construct retention basins. Retention basins are large, man-made ponds that are designed to store water during heavy rains. The water is then slowly released into the sewer system or into nearby rivers.\nThis project involves the construction of a retention basin in an urban area. The basin will be located in a low-lying area near the center of the city. The basin will have a capacity of 1 million gallons and will be lined with geotextile fabric to prevent leakage.\nBenefits of the Water Safety Engineering Project\nThe benefits of the water safety engineering project include reduced risk of flooding, improved water quality, and increased sustainability. By storing water during heavy rains, the project will reduce the risk of flooding and protect property and infrastructure. Additionally, the stored water can be used later for irrigation or other purposes."

This could include incorporating domain knowledge, such as understanding the context of an image, or using expert annotations to refine the segmentation results. Additionally, incorporating prior knowledge of object classes and their properties can also help improve performance. For example, an AI system may learn to recognize that certain objects in an image tend to have certain colors, which can be used to further refine the segmentation results. Finally, incorporating knowledge from other sources such as natural language processing can also help with instance segmentation. For example, a system may use textual descriptions of an image to better understand the objects in the scene and thus improve segmentation accuracy."

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

Nonetheless, my parents decided to take the risk and run away together. A few days after they fled, a group of bandits raided our village. They killed everyone, including my parents. I was the only survivor. I was found by a group of rangers who took me in and raised me as one of their own. I learned to hunt, track, and fight with weapons. I became a skilled ranger and swore revenge on those who destroyed my family."

        "output": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?\nI am not an expert in finance. But I'll try to answer your question as best as I can.\nWhen you buy a stock, you are purchasing a small portion of the company that issued that stock. You are essentially becoming an owner of a part of that company. As an owner, you are entitled to certain benefits, such as voting rights and dividends. Voting rights allow you to participate in important company decisions, such as elections of board members or major mergers. Dividends are payments made by the company to its shareholders as a form of profit sharing.\nNow, when you buy a stock, you are not necessarily buying it directly from the company. Instead, you are buying it from another investor who is looking to sell his/her shares. This process is called stock trading, and it takes place on the stock market. The stock market is a platform where buyers and sellers can meet and transact with each other.\nOnce you purchase the stock, the money goes directly to the seller. However, the seller may not be holding onto the stock for long. He/she may choose to sell it immediately after receiving payment, thus generating a profit. This is where the stock market comes into play. The stock market allows buyers and sellers to find each other and complete transactions.\nThe money flows from your pocket to the seller's pocket through the stock market. Then, the seller may choose to reinvest some of the profits back into the company, which helps to support its growth. Alternatively, the seller may choose to withdraw the profit and use it for personal purposes. In either case, the business you have invested in will benefit from the money that went through the stock market."

It converts a large linear partial differential equation into a set of smaller, linear algebraic equations. This makes it possible to solve problems that would be too big or complex for other methods. The basic idea behind the finite element method is to divide a larger physical domain into smaller sub-domains, called elements. In each element, the problem is simplified by assuming that the physical quantities and their derivatives are piecewise constant. Therefore, the solution to the original problem can be found by superposition of the solutions to the subproblems.\nNote: If you want to learn more about FEM contact https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af9R8bH7PtU&list=PLfhgVc9pyxCJAyX6Z1MG3LKuqpEjjz-PnIhxnE_MhA6Ndmc052"

The climate in Flagstaff is semi-arid, which means it receives little rainfall throughout the year. In fact, the average annual precipitation in Flagstaff is only about 15 inches. Despite the arid climate, Flagstaff is home to numerous bodies of water, including Lake Mary, Lake Sinagua, and Fort Valley.\nOne of the unique features of Flagstaff is its diverse population. According to the latest census, the city is home to people from over 80 different countries, speaking more than 60 different languages. This diversity is reflected in the city's restaurants, shops, and other establishments. For example, downtown Flagstaff is known for its many independent coffee shops and eateries that offer cuisine from around the world.\nAnother interesting aspect of Flagstaff is its rich cultural heritage. The city is home to several museums and historical sites that tell the story of the region's history and cultural traditions. These include the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Dunn Public Library, and the Museum of Indigenous Peoples' Art. Additionally, Flagstaff is also a hub for outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping, and skiing. The nearby San Francisco Peaks offer opportunities for snow sports, while the Coconino National Forest provides many trails for hiking and biking."

We’ll discuss creating an effective waitlist strategy, measuring its success, and providing incentives to those on the waitlist. By the end of this article, you should have a better understanding of how to create an effective waitlist and maximize your chances of success.\n\nBefore we dive into building a waitlist, let's first define what a waitlist is and why it's used. \nA waitlist is a list of people who are interested in purchasing or using a product or service but cannot do so immediately. It's typically used when a product or service is either unavailable or has limited availability. Companies use waitlists to manage demand and ensure that their products or services are not over-promoted. Waitlists can also be used as a marketing tool to generate buzz and excitement around a product or service. \nThere are several reasons why companies might use waitlists, including: \n1. Managing demand: If a product or service is in high demand, a waitlist can be used to control the number of customers who can purchase it at any given time. This can help prevent stockouts or long wait times for customers.\n\n2. Building anticipation: Waitlists can create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, which can help build excitement and generate buzz around a product or service.\n\n3. Collecting customer information: Collecting customer information through waitlists can help companies learn more about their target audience and their preferences. This can be used to inform future product or service development.\n4. Measuring interest: Waitlists can provide valuable insights into the level of interest in a product or service. This can help companies determine whether they should continue developing the product or service or pivot in a different direction.\nNow that we know why wait"

Sleep Better\nEver woken up not feeling rested at all? Weighted blankets can help. The weight automatically relaxes your nervous system, reducing cortisol (stress hormone) while increasing serotonin (happy hormone) and melatonin (sleepy hormone). So you get to sleep faster, sleep more deeply, and wake up refreshed.\n\nDEEP PRESSURE STIMULATION\n\nHELPS WITH:\nAnxiety\nADHD\nSensory Processing\nDisorder\n2. Relax &amp; De-Stress\nIf stress or anxiety is keeping you up, a weighted blanket can help. Originally invented to help people with attention or sensory disorders calm their mind and fall asleep, they calm your heart rate and breathing. Combined with the serotonin and melatonin they help release, they help reduce racing thoughts and worries.\n\n\n3. Quality Materials\nWe believe in quality products that last. Instead of the large plastic pellets many of our competitors use for weight, we use fine, non-toxic glass microbeads that distribute evenly and comfortably over your body. These weighted inserts are easy to remove for washing, and our covers are soft and durable.\n\n\n4. For Hot or Cold Sleepers\nNo matter what your preference, we’ve got you. If you’re a hot sleeper, our Hush Iced 2.0 is actively cooling; if you’re a cold sleeper, our Classic Blanket is soft and cozy. And if you want the ability to swap, our 2-in-1 Blanket bundles both for the best of both worlds!\n\n\n5. Free Shipping &amp; Money-Back Guarantee\nWe provide free shipping Canada-wide, and a 100-Night Money-Back Guarantee on all our blankets.

Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

However, the additional cost and weight of the third layer of glass in the triple pane window may not be worth the incremental increase in insulation.\nA single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window if the single pane of glass has a higher R-value than the double pane window. This can happen if the single pane of glass is made of a special material that is more effective at insulating heat, such as low-e glass. In this case, a single pane of low-e glass can provide better insulation than two panes of regular glass.
