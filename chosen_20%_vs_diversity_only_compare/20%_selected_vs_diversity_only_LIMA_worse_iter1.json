The update, known as Windows 10 Mobile, will be available for free to existing Windows Phone 8.1 handsets this fall, and it will also run on new devices from partners like Alcatel, HP, and Lenovo.\nMicrosoft is joining the likes of BlackBerry and Palm by embracing the concept of a single OS shared across multiple device types. In this case, the end goal is to bring together Windows 10 apps onto phones, tablets, and even PCs. While you won't find touch-friendly versions of full desktop apps on your phone anytime soon, Microsoft has already announced that Office Mobile apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint will be universal across all Windows 10 devices.\nJust as importantly, the OS will support Continuum, which lets you connect your phone to a mouse and keyboard and use it as a desktop computer. It will also support universal tasks like taking a phone call on your PC or resuming a video on your TV that you started on your phone.\nAnd yes, Microsoft did confirm that Windows 10 Mobile will run on ARM chips, too, though it didn't offer any specific hardware partners yet.\nWindows 10 Mobile will support all the same key enterprise features as the PC and tablet editions of Windows 10, including support for enterprise mobile management (EMM) tools (including tools like Samsung's Knox), secure boot,"

        "input": "",
        "output": "What is Dependency Injection (DI) in C#?\nDependency injection is a software design pattern that helps to reduce code complexity by allowing the dependency between objects to be injected at run time. It allows for looser coupling and makes it easier to test and maintain your code. Injection can occur either manually or through automated means. This article explains how to implement dependency injection in C# using AutoWiring and IoC containers.\nWhy would you use Dependency Injection?\nThere are many reasons why you might want to use DI, including:\nReduced code complexity – by abstracting away dependencies, you can reduce the amount of code needed to use a particular object.\nLooser coupling – because you're not tightly coupling your class to its dependencies, you have more flexibility to change them later.\nEasier testing – since you don't need to create mock objects, you can easily test your classes without worrying about their dependencies.\nMore reusable code – if you extract an object's dependencies into a container, you can easily share that object across multiple applications.\nWhat's the difference between Manual Dependency Injection and Automated Dependency Injection?\nWith manual dependency injection, you specify which objects should be injected at runtime. For example, you might have a method that takes an ILogger as an argument:\npublic void DoSomething(ILogger logger)\n{\n    // do something with the logger...\n}\nIn this case, you would need to provide an implementation of ILogger in order to call this method. With automated dependency injection, you let the framework handle specifying and resolving the dependencies for you. For example, you might have a constructor that takes no arguments:\npublic class MyObject\n{\n    public MyObject()\n    {\n        // used to log information\n    }\n}\nIn this case, the framework will automatically"

The Equality and Human Rights Commission’s latest statistics reveal that women are still paid 18.1% less than men on average (down from 18.4% in 2016). This is bad news for the government, which had hoped to close the gap by 2025. It is also bad news for anyone who believes that progress is being made towards a fairer society.\nThere is plenty of speculation as to why this gap persists. Some argue that it is due to discrimination and bias in hiring and promotion practices. Others blame it on occupational segregation and different choices between men and women about work-life balance. But these factors cannot explain the entirety of the gap.\nWhen we look at the difference in hourly pay between full-time workers, there is no gender pay gap among those aged 16-29. Why? Because when young people enter the labour market they are allocated to jobs with lower earning potential, regardless of their gender. For example, they are more likely to be employed in the retail and hospitality industries, where wages are low. As a result, when we compare all workers regardless of age, the gender pay gap increases to 18.1%.\nIn fact, the gender pay gap starts to emerge in the first year of a person’s working life. By the time they are 29, those who started work as babies doing unpaid family work receive lower wages than others, so the gap widens again. This can be explained by the “gender socialisation” of new entrants into the labour market. Young women are socialised to prioritise caring over paid employment, while young men are social"

You should be able to place at least one finger between the surface of the water and the bottom of the pan without touching the bottom of the pan.\nMake sure that the water doesn’t reach too high. Place a lid on the pan. This will stop a lot of steam from getting out, which means that your eggs won’t end up being overcooked.\n3. Gently slide your eggs into the pan once the water is hot.

The most efficient way to do this is to buy out a local co-op and threaten to shut down service unless they are allowed to join your new co-op.\nHere are some of the major regulatory barriers:\n1. You can't just build a power line and connect it to the grid.  PG&E controls where the lines go and who pays for what.  It costs about $20M/mile to string a new line.  They have thousands of miles of line.  \n2. You can't just start buying power from somewhere else.  PG&E gets preferential treatment on their purchases because they control the switches as well.  They also get a penalty if they don't use all the power they generate.  This means they have an economic incentive to generate more than they need.  If you start buying from somewhere else, they can sue you for damages and they can also cut you off.  This is why Apple's \"renewable\" program with PG&E doesn't work.  Apple signed a contract with PG&E to only buy renewable power.  When the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, Apple takes power from the rest of the grid.

When these bottles end up in landfills, they release toxic chemicals such as dioxins and furans that can contaminate soil and groundwater. In addition, when plastic bottles are incinerated, they emit harmful pollutants such as dioxins and furans into the air.\nSecondly, single-use plastic bottles have a significant impact on the environment due to their production process. The manufacturing of plastic bottles requires large amounts of energy and resources, as well as the use of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine and benzene. This process also generates significant amounts of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\nOn the other hand, reusable bottles are made from materials such as stainless steel, glass, or silicone, which are non-toxic and do not contribute to environmental pollution. Reusable bottles also reduce waste by avoiding the need for single-use plastic bottles. Additionally, reusable bottles can be washed and sanitized, reducing the risk of bacterial contamination.\nFrom a human health perspective, single-use plastic bottles can leach harmful chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) into the water they contain. These chemicals have been linked to various health problems such as reproductive issues, obesity, and cancer.\nIn conclusion, the choice between single-use plastic bottles and reusable bottles has significant implications"

With our busy lives and increased use of technology, we often communicate less face-to-face. This lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and conflict. Good communication does not just happen it must be nurtured, developed, and protected. It is important for each member of a couple to take responsibility for their own communication style and happiness in the relationship.\nThere are many ways to improve communication within a relationship. One way is to practice active listening. Active listening is the process of fully listening to what the other person is saying without judgment or interruption. It involves paying close attention to the words being said as well as the tone and context of the conversation. By actively listening, you can better understand the other person’s perspective and respond appropriately.\nAnother important aspect of effective communication is having an open dialogue. Open dialogues allow each person to express themselves freely without fear of retribution or judgment. They create a safe space for both individuals to share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Open dialogues also help to build trust and intimacy in the relationship.\nCommunication should also be honest and respectful. Honesty is essential to maintaining a healthy relationship, but it is important to be respectful of the other person’s feelings. Avoid using harsh language or making accusatory statements. Instead, clearly state your thoughts and feelings in a respectful manner. This will help to ensure that the conversation remains productive and positive.\nFinally, it is important to practice empathy when communicating in a relationship. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. When you can put yourself in the other person’s shoes, you can better understand their perspective and emotions.

However, the EU is currently facing challenges such as Brexit, the migration crisis, and concerns about the impact of globalization. In this essay, we will explore some suggestions on how to reform the EU to address these challenges and make it more effective and relevant in the 21st century.\nOne suggestion for reforming the EU is to focus on strengthening its institutions. This could include increasing the powers of the European Parliament, which is the EU's legislative body, and making the European Commission, the EU's executive body, more accountable to the Parliament.

This jocular observation can sometimes be taken too far. A prominent physicist told me recently that he thought quantum computers would never work because “nobody understands quantum mechanics,” and yet somehow we build quantum devices and control their behavior with near-perfect fidelity. (He was unimpressed when I tried to explain about measurements and decoherence.) So maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise that there are some computer scientists who don't believe P=NP, despite the overwhelming preponderance of evidence; after all, nobody really understands quantum mechanics either. And perhaps I'm uniquely susceptible to this kind of psychological manipulation, but the more I read David Cherry's new paper, “The P = BPP? Hypothesis,” the less I'm convinced that his arguments constitute a serious challenge to the standard model of computation.\nThe basic idea behind Cherry's paper is that P != NP unless one adds extra structure to the class of problems solvable in polynomial time. Not only does this structure have to make a difference when it comes to hard instances of NP-complete problems, but it has to do so in a way that gives rise to a subexponential-size circuit for most Boolean functions. There's already a lot of interesting physics here—for instance, we want a subclass of NP whose problems are easy to simulate on a quantum Turing machine, but we also don't want it to be too small!—"

Therefore, measuring brain dopamine levels would require the injection of extremely large amounts of dopamine into the brain to measure any change in brain levels.

It is also about beautiful ideas that have deep meanings. One such idea is that of infinity. Infinity is a concept that has intrigued humans since ancient times. The idea of “something that goes on forever” is beautiful in its simplicity. And when mathematicians started to explore this idea further, they found that there were many different kinds of infinity. There is “countably infinite”, which means that you can put a one-to-one correspondence between the numbers and the objects (like the integers and the points of a line). Then there is “uncountably infinite”, which is bigger than countably infinite. For example, the real numbers are uncountably infinite — you cannot put them into one-to-one correspondence with the counting numbers. But there are even more kinds of infinity. For example, how big is infinity? This is a famous question that has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Some say that infinity is larger than anything else. Others say that it cannot be compared to anything else because it is completely different. One particularly beautiful kind of infinity is transfinite infinity. This is a bit tricky to explain, but I will give it a try. Imagine that you have a set of all the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …). Now we can create a new set by adding a new element called “aleph-null”. So far so good.

The Onion Futures Act was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1958, and it has never been repealed despite numerous other commodity futures laws being struck down or repealed since then.\nThe reasons why onions have special treatment is that:\nOnions are a \"perishable\" item, and are easily spoiled or wasted before they can be delivered to market.\nOnions are not widely consumed in the United States, so there is little price risk protection for farmers or hedging for buyers.\nTherefore, there is insufficient demand for onion futures trading.\nLack of demand for onion futures means smaller volume, and therefore lower fees for traders. This means fewer people will offer their services as a broker/trader for onion futures.\nOverall, this lack of interest in trading onion futures makes it less likely that onion futures contracts will ever be profitable enough to attract legislation to repeal the act.\n\"The Onion Futures Act was passed in 1958 because the U.S. Congress recognized that onions were different from other commodities.\" - I think this quote comes from Wikipedia, but I can't find it there.

You can also make a spray by combining equal parts apple cider vinegar and water. This will work just as well.\nBoric acid is another effective way to get rid of hornets. This stuff is toxic to insects, so you don’t have to worry about hurting yourself or your family. Mix 1/4 cup of boric acid with 1/4 cup of sugar and put it into a jar. Put the lid on tightly so the ants can’t get out. Place the jar where you see the hornets and they will carry the poison back to their nest. In a few days, you should see a big reduction in their numbers.\nGarlic has natural insecticidal properties that can help get rid of hornets.

I was thinking more along the lines of placing a sheet of aluminum underneath the car that would be attached to the anode. $\\endgroup$ – user39588 Mar 10 '17 at 16:44\n$\\begingroup$ Aluminum would certainly be better than nothing... but it wouldn't be perfect. As others have mentioned, most of your corrosion will be where the road salt is directly touching the metal, and not where the salt is dripping down from above. For maximum benefit, you want to maximize the surface area of your sacrificial anode (and thus the amount of electrons it can give up). To do this without modifying the car, you could attach strips of aluminum to the bottom of the tires (or put some kind of skid-plate under them), and also coat/paint the inside of any wheel wells (where the road salt tends to collect) as well. $\\endgroup$ – Ben Crowell Mar 11 '17 at 0:42\nThe idea is sound: the sacrificial anode will corrode instead of the car. However, there are two problems with your proposed method:\nThe first problem is that, while driving, the underside of the car will be exposed to much less road salt than when parked. Thus, on average, the anode will corrode more slowly. This means that it will eventually fail before the car itself.\nThe"

        "output": "For example, you could use the Pomodoro Technique. There are also other time management techniques that will help with multitasking and focusing on multiple tasks:\n1. The Eisenhower Matrix divides tasks into four quadrants depending on their urgency and how important they are. Tasks in the upper right are things you should do immediately, those in the upper left are tasks you can do later, tasks in the lower right are tasks that can be delegated to others, and those in the lower left are tasks that aren't worth doing at all. Prioritize according to this matrix and tackle the upper right first.\n2. One of the best ways to stop multitasking is to batch similar tasks together. For example, if you are working on several reports, create a playlist of songs or podcasts to listen to while you do all of them.\n3. Learning to say \"no\" and setting boundaries around your time is an important skill for effective time management. If you feel overworked and overwhelmed, think about what you can stop doing so you have more time to focus on the tasks that really matter.\n4. Instead of working on multiple projects at once, you could work on them one after the other. This might be necessary if you only have enough bandwidth to complete one task at a time."
