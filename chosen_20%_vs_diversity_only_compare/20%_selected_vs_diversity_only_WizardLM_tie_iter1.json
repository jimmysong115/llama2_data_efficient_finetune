        "output": "\nThis code is already using promises, but it's not using async/await. Here's how you can rewrite it using async/await to make it easier to read and understand:\n```javascript\nfunction delay(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n}\nasync function sayHello(name) {\n    await delay(1000);\n    console.log('Hello, ' + name);\n}\nsayHello('Alice');\nsayHello('Bob'); // expected output: Hello, Alice (after 1 second), Hello, Bob (after another second)\n```\nIn this rewritten code, we use `async` functions instead of regular functions. `async` functions automatically wrap the code inside them in an `await` statement, which returns a promise as soon as the code has finished executing. This allows us to use `await` to wait for the `delay` function to complete before continuing with the rest of the `sayHello` function."

How can this technology be used to improve patient outcomes?\nBlockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving patient care, increasing data security and reducing costs. Some potential applications of blockchain technology in healthcare include:\n1. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) – Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure, decentralized EHR system that can store patient data in a tamper-proof ledger. This would enable healthcare providers to share patient information securely and quickly, without the need for manual recordkeeping or intermediaries.\n2. Medical Supply Chain Management – Blockchain can be used to track the movement of medical supplies and equipment, ensuring that they are authentic and not counterfeit. It can also help to prevent diversion of medications and supplies.\n3. Clinical Trials – Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and share clinical trial data, making it easier for researchers to collaborate and share results.\n4. Patient Identification – Blockchain can be used to create a secure, decentralized patient identification system that would enable healthcare providers to identify patients accurately and securely.\n5. Payment Processing – Blockchain technology can be used to process payments between healthcare providers and insurance companies quickly and securely, reducing administrative costs and improving cash flow.\nOverall, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling more efficient and secure sharing of patient data, reducing errors and improving patient safety."
