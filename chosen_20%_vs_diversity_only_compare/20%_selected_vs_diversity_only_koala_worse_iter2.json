In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

Admins receive tips when users give them Gold, and theoretically, this gives them an incentive to moderate the subreddit better.\nReddit: How do we make money?\nJeremy: This is actually the most common misconception about admins. People think we are paid by Reddit, which is not true. We are just normal users who get gifted gold from other users of the site. We put that gold into our tip jar and if we do a good job, users will fill up our tip jar.\nIf we screw up, users empty our tip jar really fast. The trick is to keep filling it back up. We typically don’t spend all of our gold right away because if we have enough, we can let our karma go negative and take out a loan against our positive karma. It’s basically a way to save gold for a rainy day.\nThe reason we ask for gold is because it’s a way to gamble on how well we are doing. If your mod team is doing a good job, users will send you gold. If you aren’t doing a good job, they won’t. Having a tip jar full of gold makes us more accountable to our users because if we aren’t doing a good job, they can remove all our privileges. If we are doing a good job, we can spend some of that gold on perks that make our lives easier."

        "input": "",
        "output": "\nMinister: Innovation is essential to the continued growth and success of the Australian economy. It drives productivity, creates jobs, increases competitiveness, fosters collaboration and spurs economic development. Innovation also enables us to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges such as climate change, ageing populations and rising inequality. Let me outline the top five benefits that innovation brings to our country.\nFirstly, innovation boosts productivity. By introducing new ideas, processes or products, businesses can become more efficient and produce more with less. This leads to higher profits, which in turn allow them to hire more people and invest in further innovation. This virtuous cycle helps to create a stronger, more prosperous economy for all Australians.\nSecondly, innovation creates jobs. According to the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, in 2017-18, innovative industries accounted for over 6 million jobs – about 40% of total employment. As we continue to innovate, we will see even more job creation in fields such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Innovation also allows businesses to adapt to changing market conditions, which means that they are more likely to survive and thrive.\nThirdly, innovation increases competitiveness. By introducing new products and processes, Australian businesses can compete more effectively with international rivals. This helps to attract investment, generate export income and build stronger trading relationships with other countries. Innovation is also critical for small businesses, which often face fierce competition from larger players.\nFourthly, innovation fosters collaboration. By sharing knowledge and working together, businesses, research institutions and government agencies can achieve much more than they could alone. This includes developing new technologies, finding solutions to complex problems and creating better ways"

The Indian government does not have any laws against online gambling, but there are some states that have made it illegal.\nCan you get in trouble for gambling online in India?\nNo, you cannot get into trouble for gambling online in India.

Once this data is collected, it can be analyzed to identify patterns and relationships between different locations. For example, you might use spatial analysis to create a map showing the location of all the fast food restaurants in a city, and then use that map to identify areas with the highest concentration of fast food joints.\nIf you’re interested in using spatial analysis for a housing or crime analysis project, there are plenty of questions you could ask. Here are a few suggestions:\n1. Where are the most affordable housing options in town?\n2. Which neighborhoods have the highest rates of crime?\n3. How do land use policies affect the spread of diseases like COVID-19?\n4. Are there any areas of the city that are particularly vulnerable to flooding?\n5.

He suggests setting aside specific activities for each child that you can do together at least once a week. Having these consistent times with your children will help them feel loved, secure and important. It will also help you to be able to bond closely with each of them as individuals.\nIn addition, Dwayne emphasizes the importance of developing patience and taking care of yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually so that you can be your best self when parenting. He encourages fathers to seek out support from other positive male role models in their lives, such as grandfathers, older brothers or male teachers at school.\nHe also stresses the importance of keeping the relationship with your child’s mother respectful and friendly and not getting drawn into her issues with the other parent so that your children won’t see you as part of the problem. After all, your primary job as a father is to give love, guidance and security to your children. Your children need both parents to cooperate in order to thrive.\nFor those who want to take their involvement to the next level, Dwayne has some great ideas on how to get more involved in your child’s education, sports and other interests so that you can form a real partnership with the mother of your children and stay close with your children as they grow."

It also helps us appreciate our own culture and heritage. By learning about the past, we gain a greater understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.\nFurthermore, documenting history is an important way to ensure that important moments in time are not forgotten. Without recorded proof, these moments may be lost forever. Documentation also serves as a reminder of the struggles and achievements of those who came before us, helping to inspire future generations.\nIn conclusion, documenting history is essential for preserving important moments in time, gaining insights into the past, and avoiding repeating mistakes.

The rate of star formation in the galaxy: 2-3 stars per year (Thompson et al. 2007)\n2. The fraction of stars with planets: 50% (Anglada et al. 2016)\n3. The likelihood of life emerging on those planets: 1/2 (Guillot 2014)\nUsing these estimates, the Drake equation can be simplified to:\nN = R * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * L\nwhere N is the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations, R is the rate of star formation, fp is the fraction of stars with planets, ne is the number of Earth-like planets per star, fl is the fraction of planetary systems with habitable zones, fi is the fraction of habitable planets with intelligent life, and fc is the fraction of civilizations that are detectable.\nAssuming reasonable values for these parameters, we can calculate the result as follows:\nN = (2-3)*(0.5)*(1/2)*(0.5)*(0.5)*(0.1) = 1.9\nSo, there may be approximately 2 civilizations in our galaxy that are detectable by us.

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a

In it, Ophir discusses the work of Fanon, Zizek, and Kahane, arguing that their approaches to violence are fundamentally interconnected. Here's the abstract:\nThis essay is a contribution to the debate on the legacy of Frantz Fanon’s work in the context of what Jacques Derrida called ‘the question of Palestine.’ In particular, I want to draw attention to the continuities between Frantz Fanon’s thought and the writings of the Israeli right-wing ideologue Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was assassinated by an Egyptian student in New York in 1990. While both thinkers share a keen interest in the themes of violence and ethnic purity, they also have a number of significant differences. Fanon’s vision of the future is based on the idea of a total liberation from colonial oppression, while Kahane’s messianic vision includes a harsh treatment of non-Jews (including Jews). Fanon sees a kind of affinity with the colonized and indigenous peoples’ struggles against colonial domination, while for Kahane it is the Jews who constitute the only pure nation. This article compares and contrasts these two thinkers, bringing into focus an important aspect of Fanon’s thought – his ambiguous attitude towards violence and terrorism - and its"

The weather will also become more extreme, with more frequent and intense storms. This will lead to more deaths and property damage.\nTo stop climate change, we need to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We can do this by using renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and by increasing energy efficiency. We also need to plant more trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere."
