        "output": "The best way to determine if someone is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply being polite is to look for signs of engagement and reciprocation in their body language, facial expressions, and verbal responses. For example, if someone maintains eye contact, leans forward slightly, and responds with relevant comments and questions, they are likely genuinely interested in the conversation. On the other hand, if someone looks uncomfortable, avoids eye contact, and only gives one-word responses, they may be being polite out of obligation."
