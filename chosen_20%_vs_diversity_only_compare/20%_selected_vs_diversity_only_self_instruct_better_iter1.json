Try to understand that he might be feeling lonely and out of his comfort zone, even though it’s your trip. Start talking about what he’d like to do and try to find activities that please both of you. You could also split up some of the time, but do so in a way that makes sense logistically and doesn’t put you in separate cars.\nAs for the car, offer to pay for your half up front, and then he pays the other half once he finds his own car.

        "output": "\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of consumer electronics, such as the radio. The radio allowed for increased access to music as it could be broadcast to large numbers of people at once. This led to the development of new styles of music that were tailored for mass appeal. Examples of these types of music include Tin Pan Alley and Hillbilly music.\nNew media and technologies also emerged during this time that allowed for easier recording, editing, and distribution of music. The phonograph was patented in 1877 and began to be mass-produced by the beginning of the 20th century. It revolutionized the music industry by making it possible to distribute recordings of musical performances on a large scale. In the 1920s, the talking picture or \"talkie\" replaced silent films and introduced sound recording to cinema. During this period, musicians began to be paid royalties for their work, which had previously been considered an honorarium.\nThe performance of music became more visual with the advent of television and video recordings. The introduction of rock and roll culture in the 1950s made performing on stage even more important. Some performers such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles became extremely popular, selling out concerts wherever they played.\nMusic of the 20th century is often characterized by its diversity and experimentation. New styles of music called modern music were created, including atonal music, twelve-tone music, and serialism. Important composers of the 20th century included Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, John Cage, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

The service was ok, not great, but not the worst.\nThe bread was very good. I ordered the muscle fries. They had a sweet Vidalia onion flavor. No need for fries bc they were soggy wo much flavor. My boyfriend ordered a pesto chicken pasta and it was again mediocre.",
        "output": " No pesto flavor at all. It was a good portion size and the pasta was al dente but that’s it.\nWe both got drinks from the specialty cocktail menu. My boyfriend got the tiki drink which was fantastic. I got the tequila sunrise and it was just ok."

        "output": "Dan Pink, author of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, describes three key factors for motivating people in his TED talk. In summary, they are:\nAutonomy – the desire to direct our own lives\nMastery – the urge to get better and better at things\nPurpose – the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves\nI’d like to suggest a simple training challenge that addresses all three of these factors on Strava. My idea is to create an event called “The 50/12 Challenge”, where participants would attempt to ride 50 miles or run 12 miles in under two hours on a specific day. Here are some reasons why I think this is a good idea:\n1. Autonomy – participants can choose when they want to complete the challenge, as long as it’s within a month. They can also choose whether to do it on a road bike or a mountain bike, or on foot.\n2. Mastery – the challenge requires a reasonable level of fitness, but it’s not so difficult that it’s impossible for most people. By setting a time limit, participants have the opportunity to improve their performance over time as their fitness increases.\n3. Purpose – the challenge has a clear goal, which serves as a motivator. Participants know that they need to complete the challenge within two hours to earn the “badge” on Strava. Additionally, completing the challenge contributes to a greater cause, such as supporting a local charity.\nOverall, the 50/12 Challenge would be a fun and engaging way to motivate people to train while also addressing key elements of motivation as described by Dan Pink."
