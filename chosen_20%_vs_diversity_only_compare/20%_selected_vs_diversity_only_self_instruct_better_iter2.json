Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
        "output": " Moreover, in the 20th century, the Russian constructivists promoted architecture and design based on mathematical principles.\nThe appreciation of mathematics in art can take many forms. In geometry, for example, one can see the use of projective geometry in Mondrian's work: in his later career he limited himself to using only three colors, black, white, and red. Other examples are the Islamic gardens that have been drawn according to the mathematical theory of the Spirograph; the harmony and balance found in Japanese gardens is partly a result of the use of symmetry and proportion; and the study of tessellations has inspired artists such as Escher to create works like Relief with Spheres."

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",

The heart rate of study participants increased by an average of 5 beats per minute, or about 40%, compared to when they were exposed to a completely dark room. After one night with the dim light, heart rates remained elevated over the following two nights of complete darkness.\nLight is known to suppress the release of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. But Zee said previous studies have shown that lower levels of melatonin do not fully explain the increase in blood sugar and heart rate associated with sleeping in the dark.\n\"We know that light at night can suppress melatonin and that melatonin can lower your blood pressure,\" she said. \"But our results show that something else is going on. In fact, we think that the extra activity in the brain may be what's increasing blood sugar levels.\"\nThe study also looked at whether exercise might help counteract any negative effects of sleeping in the dim light. The researchers discovered that while exercise did decrease the amount of glucose the young people's bodies produced, it didn't entirely reverse the negative impact of sleeping with the dim light.\n\"Exercise is great for improving insulin sensitivity and lowering blood sugar, but if you are exercising late at night, then you are probably more likely to be exposed to light, because you are outdoors or in a well-lit gym,\" she said. \"So we don't think exercise is enough to completely prevent these negative health effects from dim light exposure.\"\nZee added that the study shows how vital it is to keep bedrooms dark at night, including using blackout shades or wearing an eye covering to block out light.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",
